    <h2>&quot;The people want the fall of the regime&quot;</h2>

<p>Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year old Tunisian fruit vendor, set himself on fire in a final act of protest after being harassed and beaten by the police. This action, which took place on December 17, 2010, is viewed as the spark that ignited a revolutionary movement. People took to the streets in opposition to the dictatorial regime of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, which had stripped Bouazizi and many other Tunisians of justice and dignity over the course of 23 years. YouTube and cell phone videos spread the news that others were demonstrating against the regime and made the violence of Ben Ali&#39;s security forces more apparent. The people could no longer be placated by promises of economic relief. Then, after being ordered to fire on demonstrators, the military turned on Ben Ali who resigned and fled the country on January 14, 2011—less than a month after Bouazizi&#39;s self immolation.</p>

<p>Not two weeks after, Egypt&#39;s Day of Revolt on January 25, 2011 made it clear that what was happening was the start of something bigger than a sporadic outburst of discontent; within a month, protests had also begun in Yemen, Sudan, Bahrain, and Libya. The cry heard around the world was clear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام‎<br>
Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam<br>
(The people want the fall of the regime)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This message was—and continues to be—disseminated via social media channels like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter in countries such as Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. It&#39;s been over four years since the initial uprisings, and the embers of emancipation are still glowing throughout the Middle East/North African (MENA) region today, though the tone and the pace of change varies.</p>

<h2>Social media&#39;s role</h2>

<p>It&#39;s undeniable that social media has played a role in the MENA uprisings, but <em>what</em> role it has played is still a matter of debate. Some posit that social media was the driver behind the revolutions while others argue that it was only a component in a much more complex system and an echo of the past.</p>

<p>This project intends to further inspect the relationship(s) between social media and the revolutions of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya as some of the first countries impacted by this movement. I will review the background of these countries to see which factors may have contributed to the uprisings. Then, I&#39;ll assess public analyses of social media&#39;s historic role in the movements as well as its current function in the three countries. Finally, I&#39;ll consider the status of the governments&#39; democratic efforts to date. Each of these topics will be addressed by country in individual blog posts, so there will be three background posts—one for Tunisia, one for Egypt, and one for Libya—and so on.</p>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>The review of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya&#39;s histories and the assessment of their present-day situations will be used to better understand what makes a revolutionary movement—particularly one involving social media—take hold more effectively in some places than in others. A more comprehensive perspective on the role of social media in conflict is of significant importance today as governments fund research programs that &quot;model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world&quot; <a href="#ahmed">(Ahmed, 2014)</a>, develop software that spread propaganda via social media <a href="#fielding">(Fielding &amp; Cobain, 2011)</a>, and as political entities use social media to recruit <a href="#bleiberg">(Bleiberg &amp; West, 2014)</a> or to further incite conflict <a href="#finighan">(Finighan, 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an understatement to say that treating social media as a cure-all without any side effects is dangerous; governmental and non-governmental institutions alike must be sure to consider the potential repercussions. For instance, a recent study found that social media could cause desensitization rather than motivation during times of increased violence <a href="#georgia-institute-tech">(“Drug war violence in Mexico connected with desensitization in social media,” 2014)</a>. Inasmuch as social media can be used to combat terrorism, it can also be used to promote terrorism <a href="#hui">(Hui, 2010)</a>. Finally, social media is a double-edged sword that can be wielded by and against the enemy<a href="#kirchner">(Kirchner, 2014)</a>.</p>

<h2>&quot;Arab Spring&quot;</h2>

<p>The West has dubbed the revolutions of the MENA region the &quot;Arab Spring,&quot; which might suggest that the movement is primarily focused on a democratic transition or &quot;democratic blooming,&quot; but Maytha Alhassen, one of the editors of <em>Demanding Dignity: Young Voices from the Front Lines of the Arab Revolutions</em> pointed out in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maytha-alhassen/please-reconsider-arab-sp_b_1268971.html?">this post</a> that &quot;what is going on in the MENA is something deeper than a democratic transformation, it is what democracy is predicated on—a demand for recognizing the right to human dignity.&quot; Further to this point, the editors of <em>Demanding Dignity: Young Voices from the Front Lines of the Arab Revolutions</em> noted: &quot;as we began to solicit essays from high-profile figures and grassroots activists, we discovered that our call for stories for a book on the &#39;Arab Spring&#39; fell on deaf ears&quot; <a href="#dignity">(Alhassen &amp; Shihab-Eldin, 2012, p. 4282)</a>. They found that the terms <em>uprisings</em>, <em>Arab awakening</em>, <em>revolutions</em>, and <em>revolutionary movements</em> were most prevalent, but &quot;the unifying theme across all these revolutions was karama, dignity&quot; <a href="#dignity">(Alhassen &amp; Shihab-Eldin, 2012, p. 4292)</a>.</p>

<p>In an attempt to better align with the focus and intent of those participating in the movements in the Middle East and North Africa, future posts will primarily refer to the regional events of this project as the Arab uprisings.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>The backgrounds of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya will each be discussed in separate posts. See <a href="/projects/arab-uprisings/summary">here</a> for more details.</p>
