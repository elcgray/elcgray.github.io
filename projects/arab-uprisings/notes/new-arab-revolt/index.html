  <h4><span id="cfr"><i>The New Arab Revolt: What Happened, What It Means, and What Comes Next</i>. (2011) (Kindle). Council on Foreign Relations.</span></h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Introduction Gideon Rose <strong>loc</strong> 183</p>

<ul>
<li>The smart money, such as it was, didn’t think Tunisia was on the verge of an eruption, didn’t think the upheaval would spread from Tunisia to Egypt, didn’t think the shocks would reverberate around the Middle East. <strong>loc</strong> 202</li>
<li>Goldstone asks what sort of revolutions these uprisings actually were and what implications the answer has for what the future holds. <strong>loc</strong> 244   Note: indeed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Sorrows of Egypt A Tale of Two Men Fouad Ajami FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1995 <strong>loc</strong> 255</p>

<ul>
<li>This tension in the psyche and politics of Egypt will persist: between Sadat’s world, with its temptations and its window on modernity, and Istanbuli’s world, with its rigors and its furious determination to keep the West at bay. A fissure has opened, right in the heart of Egypt’s traditionally stoic and reliable middle class. A wing of this class has defected to theocratic politics. The rest are disaffected and demoralized. There is no resolution in sight for this dilemma. <strong>loc</strong> 290</li>
<li>The sorrow of Egypt is made of entirely different material: the steady decline of its public life, the inability of an autocratic regime and of the middle class from which this regime issues to rid the country of its dependence on foreign handouts, to transmit to the vast underclass the skills needed for the economic competition of nations, to take the country beyond its endless alternation between false glory and self-pity. <strong>loc</strong> 299</li>
<li>In our fixation on the Iranian Revolution—the armed imam chasing Caesar out of power—we have looked for it everywhere and grafted its themes and outcomes onto societies possessed of vastly different traditions and temperaments. <strong>loc</strong> 304</li>
<li>Even the men who gunned down Sadat were under no illusions about their own power in the face of the state. No fools, these men knew the weight of the state, the strength of all they were hurling themselves against. <strong>loc</strong> 307</li>
<li>Contempt for the government there is aplenty in Egypt today, but the political and cultural continuity of the place has not ruptured. <strong>loc</strong> 316</li>
<li>central authority in Egypt reaches back millennia. <strong>loc</strong> 318</li>
<li>beyond the modernity of Cairo and Alexandria, away from the glare of publicity, the running war between the police and the Islamicists degenerated into the timeless politics of vengeance and vendettas, an endless cycle of killings and reprisals. <strong>loc</strong> 323</li>
<li>Tough police work was one side of the response to the terror of the Islamicists; the other was a discernible retreat on the part of the regime from secular politics and culture. <strong>loc</strong> 333</li>
<li>The custodians of the state drew a line between the legitimate and moderate Islamic groups and the armed Islamicists. While the regime hunted down the latter, it made its peace with the former. <strong>loc</strong> 338</li>
<li>Preachers and religious activists drawn from the ranks of the old Muslim Brotherhood, an organization now sanitized and made respectable in comparison with the younger, more uncompromising members of the Gamaat, were given access to the airwaves and the print media and became icons of popular culture. They dabbled in incendiary material, these respectable sorts, careful to stay on the proper side of the line. They advocated an Islamic state but said they would seek it through legitimate means. <strong>loc</strong> 340</li>
<li>There the advocates of political Islam, their apparent zeal and devotion a marked contrast to the abdication all around, had gone to work, weaning the young from the dominant symbols and outlook of the secular political order. <strong>loc</strong> 352 Note: role of education</li>
<li>The country feels trapped, cheated, and shortchanged in the battle between an inept, authoritarian state and a theocratic fringe. <strong>loc</strong> 357 Note: strong statement</li>
<li>the commentator Karim Alrawi warned that the modernizing imperative that has dominated and driven Egypt since the early 1800s after its encounter with Europe is being reversed. <strong>loc</strong> 379</li>
<li>It is out of this disappointment that a powerful wave of nostalgia has emerged for the liberal interlude in Egyptian politics (the 1920s through the revolution of 1952), for its vibrant political life, for the lively press of the time, for the elite culture with its literati and artists, for its outspoken, emancipated women who had carved a place for themselves in the country’s politics, culture, and journalism. <strong>loc</strong> 381</li>
<li>The Americans, he believes, feel quite comfortable with authoritarianism. The American fear of a fundamentalist takeover, he observes, plays into the hands of Mubarak’s regime. <strong>loc</strong> 405</li>
<li>The facts of Egypt’s poverty and need are so well known that one hardly need state them. One set of figures reveals the trouble: 400,000 people enter the job market every year; 75 percent of the new entrants are unemployed; 90 percent of these people have intermediate or higher education diplomas. <strong>loc</strong> 413</li>
<li>The age of wars has ended; in Egypt today it is the age of words, and because words feed off one another the land of Egypt will only know the reign of words. <strong>loc</strong> 424</li>
<li>from the time Napoleon Bonaparte’s armada turned up off the coast of Alexandria in the summer of 1798, Egypt’s history has in the main been its Sisyphean quest for modernity and national power. <strong>loc</strong> 426</li>
<li>“Egypt is richer than any country in the world in corn, rice, vegetables, and cattle. But the people are in a state of utter backwardness.” <strong>loc</strong> 432</li>
<li>the urge for national progress, and the grief at being so near and yet so far, have defined the Egyptian experience in the modern world. <strong>loc</strong> 436</li>
<li>Then came Nasser’s bid, perhaps Egypt’s most heartbreaking moment of false promise: import substitution, pan-Arabism, a place in the nonaligned world, a national army that looked imposing and fierce before the whole edifice of Nasserism came crashing down. <strong>loc</strong> 446</li>
<li>Pity the air force officer who now presides over a country groaning under the weight of its numbers, scrambling to pay for its food imports, reconciling its claims to greatness with the fact of its dependence on American power and largess. <strong>loc</strong> 450</li>
<li>The economy remains a hybrid. It combines a wild form of laissez-faire capitalism for the sharks and fat cats who raid the place with subsidies for the poorer classes. <strong>loc</strong> 454</li>
<li>Four decades of positioning the country for foreign assistance from the Soviet Union, the Arab oil states, and the United States have done terrible damage to Egypt. A political economy and a mentality of dependence have set in. <strong>loc</strong> 457</li>
<li>Egypt’s primacy in Arab politics is a thing of the past. Arabs have gone their own separate ways. <strong>loc</strong> 512</li>
<li>The country is too wise, too knowing, too tolerant to succumb to a reign of theocratic zeal. <strong>loc</strong> 531</li>
<li>The danger here is not that of sudden, cataclysmic upheaval, but of the steady descent into deeper levels of pauperization, of the lapse of the country’s best into apathy and despair, of Egypt falling yet again through the trap door of its history of disappointment. <strong>loc</strong> 533</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Back to the Bazaar Martin Indyk FOREIGN AFFAIRS, JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2002 <strong>loc</strong> 540</p>

<ul>
<li>President Hosni Mubarak’s government had become, to use Shakespeare’s words, “weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable”—except, of course, for those lucky enough to be associated with it. <strong>loc</strong> 592</li>
<li>A high-level initiative, led by Vice President Al Gore, tried to get Mubarak to reform, privatize, and deregulate the Egyptian economy, in the belief that successful liberalization and modernization would have a profound demonstration effect on the rest of the Arab world and help Mubarak meet the basic needs of his people. But the Gore-Mubarak Commission was very much a partnership in which the United States provided encouragement but let the Egyptians dictate the pace. <strong>loc</strong> 597</li>
<li>Their bargain worked because they had a common interest in maintaining the stability of the status quo. <strong>loc</strong> 625 Note: familiar</li>
<li>The effective suppression of the Islamist opposition in Egypt and Saudi Arabia forced the extremists first to seek refuge and then to set up operations outside the region, in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States. The al Qaeda network established by bin Laden (a Saudi) and his associate Ayman al-Zawahiri (an Egyptian) wanted to overthrow the Saudi and Egyptian regimes, but with U.S. support these governments had become hardened targets. So al Qaeda made a strategic decision to strike at their patron, the more powerful but also more vulnerable United States. <strong>loc</strong> 633</li>
<li>the Mubarak government confronted its violent and ruthless Islamist opposition with brute force. The resulting conflict cost more than 1,200 lives between 1992 and 1997. Given the terrorist tactics of the Islamist militants, the <strong>loc</strong> 659</li>
<li>regime’s response appeared the only answer. Along the way, however, Cairo also suppressed legitimate dissent, effectively reducing the already limited space allowed for civil society. <strong>loc</strong> 661</li>
<li>An anti-American consensus was created between Islamist fundamentalists on the right, who regarded Americans as infidels; pan-Arab nationalists on the left, who viewed Americans as imperialists; and the regime itself, which found it convenient for the Egyptian intellectual class to criticize the United States and Israel rather than its own government’s shortcomings. <strong>loc</strong> 665</li>
<li>The United States also needs its Arab allies to make the case to their own people and to Muslims everywhere that U.S. objectives are justified because the terrorists have defamed Islam and done great damage to the Islamic cause. <strong>loc</strong> 703 Note: same struggle today with isil</li>
<li>In the past, recognizing that the dynamics of change in traditional societies could be deeply destabilizing, Washington posed the choice as one “between corruption and chaos.” It opted to back corrupt governments because it feared that the alternative would be worse for vital U.S. interests. <strong>loc</strong> 726</li>
<li>Whatever the shortcomings of these regimes, fundamentalist alternatives are bound to be worse for the Egyptian and Saudi people, as they were for Iran and Afghanistan. And revolution in Saudi Arabia and Egypt could have a devastating impact on vital U.S. interests in the Middle East. Yet if they do not change their ways, over time these regimes could fall anyway, and in the meantime their failings may continue to generate unacceptable threats to U.S. national security. <strong>loc</strong> 733 Note: similar gamble today</li>
<li>The Saudis and the Egyptians will also need to be encouraged to develop a more tolerant model of Islam, one more reconciled to modernity, as an alternative to the hatred and xenophobia now propagated through school and mosque. And they will have to be prodded into undertaking economic reforms that can provide meaningful employment and the hope of a better future for their young people, who now make up the majority in these countries. <strong>loc</strong> 739 Note: what is the ratio of young to old today?</li>
<li>one question to examine is whether Islamic states that have embarked on political and economic reform can provide models for others to emulate. <strong>loc</strong> 746 Note: are there any today?</li>
<li>the United States will have to persuade the Egyptian and Saudi governments to attend to its short-term needs in the continuing war on terrorism and to begin working on their own long-term need to address more effectively their people’s basic requirements for greater political and economic progress. <strong>loc</strong> 755</li>
<li>the United States can no longer afford to desist from this longer-term task. <strong>loc</strong> 761</li>
<li>Merely listing the parameters of such a new deal with the leaders of the Arab world suggests how difficult and daunting the task of negotiating it will be. The main reason even to try, in fact, is simply because the United States has few alternatives. If it allows another return to business as usual, as it did after the Gulf War, it will sow the seeds of its own destruction in the Middle East—and that of its regional allies as well. <strong>loc</strong> 765</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Freedom and Justice in the Modern Middle East Bernard Lewis FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2005 <strong>loc</strong> 769</p>

<ul>
<li>In Arabic usage at that time and for some time after, the word “freedom”—hurriyya—was in no sense a political term. It was a legal term. One was free if one was not a slave. To be liberated, or freed, meant to be manumitted, and in the Islamic world, unlike in the Western world, “slavery” and “freedom” were not until recently used as metaphors for bad and good government. <strong>loc</strong> 797</li>
<li>“When the French talk about freedom,” he says, “what they mean is what we Muslims call justice.” <strong>loc</strong> 809</li>
<li>Just as the French, and more generally Westerners, thought of good government and bad government as freedom and slavery, so Muslims conceived of them as justice and injustice. These contrasting perceptions help shed light on the political debate that began in the Muslim world with the 1798 French expion and that has been going on ever since, in a remarkable variety of forms. <strong>loc</strong> 810 Note: interesting consideration</li>
<li>If a ruler is to qualify as just, as defined in the traditional Islamic system of rules and ideas, he must meet two requirements: he must have acquired power rightfully, and he must exercise it rightfully. In other words, he must be neither a usurper nor a tyrant. It is of course possible to be either one without the other, although the normal experience was to be both at the same time. <strong>loc</strong> 817 Note: how did revoluionaries in arab spring depict rulers they overthrew?</li>
<li>from the very beginning of Muslim scripture, jurisprudence, and political culture, there have been two distinct traditions: one, dating from the Meccan period, might be called activist; the other, dating from the Medina period, quietist. <strong>loc</strong> 828 Note: important consideration</li>
<li>there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, “there is no obedience in sin”; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, “do not obey a creature against his creator,” again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be. <strong>loc</strong> 832 Note: duty of disobedience</li>
<li>Muslims have been interested from the very beginning in the problems of politics and government: the acquisition and exercise of power, succession, legitimacy, and—especially relevant here—the limits of authority. <strong>loc</strong> 838 Note: political history</li>
<li>In the course of time, the quietist, or authoritarian, trend grew stronger, and it became more difficult to maintain those limitations on the autocracy of the ruler that had been prescribed by holy scripture and holy law. And so the literature places increasing stress on the need for order. A word used very frequently in the discussions is fitna, an Arabic term that can be translated as “sion,” “disorder,” “disturbance,” and even “anarchy” in certain contexts. The point is made again and again, with obvious anguish and urgency: tyranny is better than anarchy. <strong>loc</strong> 845 Note: tyranny vs. anarchy</li>
<li>Phase one began with Bonaparte’s incursion and continued through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when Middle Eastern rulers, painfully aware of the need to catch up with the modern world, tried to modernize their societies, beginning with their governments. <strong>loc</strong> 878</li>
<li>Modernizing meant introducing Western systems of communication, warfare, and rule, inevitably including the tools of domination and repression. <strong>loc</strong> 882</li>
<li>But perhaps an even worse result of modernization was the abrogation of the intermediate powers in society—the landed gentry, the city merchants, the tribal chiefs, and others—which in the traditional order had effectively limited the authority of the state. <strong>loc</strong> 886</li>
<li>on the one hand the state was getting stronger and more pervasive, and on the other hand the limitations and controls were being whittled away. <strong>loc</strong> 888</li>
<li>“The old nobility lived on their estates,” he concludes. “The state is the estate of the new nobility.” This is a profound truth and, in the light of subsequent and current developments, a remarkably prescient formulation. <strong>loc</strong> 893</li>
<li>Syria-Lebanon was wide open to the Nazis, who moved in and made it the main base of their propaganda and activity in the Arab world. It was at that time that the ideological foundations of what later became the Baath Party were laid, with the adaptation of Nazi ideas and methods to the Middle Eastern situation. The nascent party’s ideology emphasized pan-Arabism, nationalism, and a form of socialism. The party was not officially founded until April 1947, but memoirs of the time and other sources show that the Nazi interlude is where it began. From Syria, the Germans and the proto-Baathists also set up a pro-Nazi regime in Iraq, led by the famous, and notorious, Rashid Ali al-Gailani. <strong>loc</strong> 900 Note: role of nazis</li>
<li>In the years that followed the end of World War II, the British and the French departed, and after a brief interval the Soviets moved in. The leaders of the Baath Party easily switched from the Nazi model to the communist model, needing only minor adjustments. This was a party not in the Western sense of an organization built to win elections and votes. It was a party in the Nazi and Communist sense, part of the government apparatus particularly concerned with indoctrination, surveillance, and repression. <strong>loc</strong> 908 Note: baath party&#39;s roots</li>
<li>Since 1940 and again after the arrival of the Soviets, the Middle East has basically imported European models of rule: fascist, Nazi, and communist. But to speak of dictatorship as being the immemorial way of doing things in that part of the world is simply untrue. It shows ignorance of the Arab past, contempt for the Arab present, and unconcern for the Arab future. <strong>loc</strong> 913 Note: strong statement</li>
<li>Another, more traditional hurdle is the absence in classical Islamic political thought and practice of the notion of citizenship, in the sense of being a free and participating member of a civic entity. <strong>loc</strong> 922</li>
<li>It, and the idea of the people participating not just in the choice of a ruler but in the conduct of government, is not part of traditional Islam. <strong>loc</strong> 925</li>
<li>The traditional rejection of despotism, of istibdad, has gained a new force and a new urgency: Europe may have disseminated the ideology of dictatorship, but it also spread a corresponding ideology of popular revolt against dictatorship. <strong>loc</strong> 934</li>
<li>consultation by the government with various entrenched interests and loyalty groups. This is the purpose of the Loya Jirga, the “grand council” that consists of a wide range of different groups—ethnic, tribal, religious, regional, professional, and others. <strong>loc</strong> 940</li>
<li>Perhaps the single most important development is the adoption of modern communications. The printing press and the newspaper, the telegraph, the radio, and the television have all transformed the Middle East. Initially, communications technology was an instrument of tyranny, giving the state an effective new weapon for propaganda and control. But this trend could not last indefinitely. More recently, particularly with the rise of the Internet, television satellites, and cell phones, communications technology has begun to have the opposite effect. <strong>loc</strong> 943</li>
<li>The information revolution posed the same dilemma for the Soviet Union as the Industrial Revolution did for the Ottoman and other Islamic empires: either accept it and cease to exist in the same manner or reject it and fall increasingly behind the rest of the world. <strong>loc</strong> 950 Note: adapt or die</li>
<li>Even some of the intensely and unscrupulously propagandist television programs that now infest the airwaves contribute to this process, indirectly and unintentionally, by offering a diversity of lies that arouse suspicion and questioning. Television also brings to the peoples of the Middle East a previously unknown spectacle—that of lively and vigorous public disagreement and debate. <strong>loc</strong> 953</li>
<li>Modern communications have also had another effect, in making Middle Eastern Muslims more painfully aware of how badly things have gone wrong. <strong>loc</strong> 960</li>
<li>The main threat to the development of democracy in Iraq and ultimately in other Arab and Muslim countries lies not in any inherent social quality or characteristic, but in the very determined efforts that are being made to ensure democracy’s failure. The opponents of democracy in the Muslim world come from very different sources, with sharply contrasting ideologies. An alliance of expediency exists between different groups with divergent interests. <strong>loc</strong> 977 Note: threats to democratic movements</li>
<li>Most dangerous are the so-called Islamic fundamentalists, those for whom democracy is part of the greater evil emanating from the West, whether in the old-fashioned form of imperial domination or in the more modern form of cultural penetration. <strong>loc</strong> 984</li>
<li>The fundamentalist response to Western rule and still more to Western social and cultural influence has been gathering force for a long time. It has found expression in an increasingly influential literature and in a series of activist movements, the most notable of which is the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928. <strong>loc</strong> 992</li>
<li>The word “revolution” has been much misused in the Middle East and has served to designate and justify almost any violent transfer of power at the top. <strong>loc</strong> 994</li>
<li>One, the Wahhabi Saudis now ruled the holy cities and therefore controlled the annual Muslim pilgrimage, which gave them immense prestige and influence in the Islamic world. Two, the discovery and exploitation of oil placed immense wealth at their disposal. <strong>loc</strong> 1011</li>
<li>What would otherwise have been an extremist fringe in a marginal country thus had a worldwide impact. <strong>loc</strong> 1013</li>
<li>In a genuinely free election, fundamentalists would have several substantial advantages over moderates and reformers. One is that they speak a language familiar to Muslims. Democratic parties promote an ideology and use a terminology mostly strange to the “Muslim street.” <strong>loc</strong> 1020 Note: power of using common language</li>
<li>To broadcast this message, the fundamentalists utilize an enormously effective network that meets and communicates in the mosque and speaks from the pulpit. None of the secular parties has access to anything comparable. Religious revolutionaries, and even terrorists, also gain support because of their frequently genuine efforts to alleviate the suffering of the common people. This concern often stands in marked contrast with the callous and greedy unconcern of the current wielders of power and influence in the Middle East. <strong>loc</strong> 1023 Note: appeal of isil?</li>
<li>democratic parties are ideologically bound to allow fundamentalists freedom of action. The fundamentalists suffer from no such disability; on the contrary, it is their mission when in power to suppress sion and unbelief. <strong>loc</strong> 1029 Note: signihcant weakness</li>
<li>Adrift on the Nile The Limits of the Opposition in Egypt Steven A. Cook FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MARCH/APRIL 2009 <strong>loc</strong> 1046</li>
<li>During the so-called Arab Spring of early 2005, Iraqis went to the polls for the first time since the demise of Saddam Hussein, Syria withdrew from Lebanon after one million protesters descended on central Beirut, and Saudi Arabia staged municipal elections. In Cairo, activists from across the political spectrum, having grown more confident and savvy, forced the regime of President Hosni Mubarak to cast itself as reform-minded, which loosened the reins on the opposition. The orial pages of Western newspapers were asking triumphantly if the Middle East had finally arrived at that mythic tipping point. <strong>loc</strong> 1052</li>
<li>the opposition was divided along fault lines that had vexed Egyptian politics for six decades. <strong>loc</strong> 1061</li>
<li>A perennial target of this firepower, sometimes literally, has been the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group founded by Hasan al-Banna in 1928 to save Egyptian society from what he thought was the West’s depraving influence. The Brotherhood’s mission was to re-Islamize Egypt from below through preaching, education, good works, and even (between the 1940s and the 1960s) violence. It hoped to foster among the Egyptian masses so much demand for a system based on Islam that Egypt’s leaders would have to either submit or be swept away. <strong>loc</strong> 1078 Note: plight of muslim brotherhood</li>
<li>Rutherford’s narrative is compelling because, unlike many Western analyses of the movement, which tend to portray the Brotherhood as static, it conveys a sophisticated understanding of the Brotherhood’s development. Rutherford demonstrates not only that the organization has not engaged in violence during this time but also that it has managed to participate in highly circumscribed elections despite being outlawed by making alliances with parties of various ideological inclinations and proffering electoral platforms that have been in many ways unmistakably liberal. <strong>loc</strong> 1097</li>
<li>Rutherford’s account suggests that various political pressures and incentives have forced the leaders of Egypt’s Islamist movement to pursue the path of moderation. This is an interesting insight, as it implies that the Brotherhood, like Europe’s religious parties over a century ago (or, more recently, Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party), could evolve into a political group only notionally tied to religion. <strong>loc</strong> 1106</li>
<li>Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan or the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia, Rutherford claims, the Muslim Brotherhood is interested in establishing a state based not on a strict reading of Islamic law but on principles inspired by it that are inclusive and compatible with modernity. <strong>loc</strong> 1117</li>
<li>The leaders of the Egyptian regime, for example, speak openly about reform and democratization, but they do so with enough ambiguity to nonetheless pursue an inherently antidemocratic agenda. <strong>loc</strong> 1123</li>
<li>whether the Muslim Brothers genuinely are liberals is an empirical question analysts will not be able to answer until they actually govern. <strong>loc</strong> 1127</li>
<li>Egypt’s judges had proved that they could in many ways act as the conscience of the Egyptian people, many of whom want a more open and democratic future. Without becoming partisan themselves or pouring into the streets as the lawyers of Pakistan regularly do, Egypt’s judges can help shape Egypt’s political future. <strong>loc</strong> 1150</li>
<li>More than any domestic player, it is the IMF that has constrained the Egyptian government’s economic policymaking. <strong>loc</strong> 1169</li>
<li>acknowledges, after a short period of relative political openness between 2003 and early 2005, the political space available to Egypt’s opposition has closed considerably. Bloggers, journalists, ors, democracy activists, and judges have been harassed, arrested, beaten, raped, and, in one high-profile case, driven out of the country. Egypt watchers have seen such openings and closings of the public sphere many times before, under Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak. <strong>loc</strong> 1181</li>
<li>Just as Sadat and Mubarak first promised a more open political environment to garner the goodwill of the people but then quickly reneged, Egypt’s next president will crack down as soon as openness threatens to morph into political challenge—a threshold that is easily met in Egypt. <strong>loc</strong> 1186</li>
<li>Authoritarianism will not rule Egypt forever. But with a track record of some 7,000 years already, it could remain the law of the land for a very long time to come. <strong>loc</strong> 1192</li>

<ul>
<li>Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali fled Tunisia after 23 years as president. <strong>loc</strong> 1281</li>
<li>unemployment, inflation, and the high cost of living. <strong>loc</strong> 1283</li>
<li>material difficulties were not the central driver in pushing Ben Ali from power. <strong>loc</strong> 1284</li>
<li>Tunisians are protesting dictatorship. <strong>loc</strong> 1287</li>
<li>Ben Ali cracked down against free speech and any potential dissent. He cited the danger posed by the country’s Islamists, who gave some cause for concern over the extent to which, if elected, they would respect democracy and the relatively equal rights Tunisian women had achieved after independence. <strong>loc</strong> 1291</li>
<li>Ben Ali’s Tunisia would come to have zero press freedoms, a censored Internet, monitored phone and e-mail communications, and only token opposition in a toothless parliament. <strong>loc</strong> 1295</li>
<li>The state-run media participated in grotesque displays of hagiography and helped produce a cult of personality around the president, whose portrait hung everywhere. The media lauded his initiatives as unambiguously and gloriously advancing the interests of all Tunisians, with Ben Ali the ever avuncular and enlightened ruler. <strong>loc</strong> 1298</li>
<li>dissidents were tortured and everyday Tunisians struggled to build livelihoods, while the families of the president and those connected to him enriched themselves and flaunted their wealth. <strong>loc</strong> 1301</li>
<li>Few saw last week’s events coming. In this regard, the fall of Ben Ali had much in common with the street protests that swept communist rulers from power in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s. No one predicted those governments would collapse, either—yet in 1989, the world witnessed what Timur Kuran, the Duke professor and economist, would later call “now out of never.” Kuran argued that under such dictatorships, citizens are required to act in public as if they are content with the status quo. If they do not, the wrath of the security apparatus falls upon them. <strong>loc</strong> 1304</li>
<li>But people bear an internal cost—to their sense of autonomy and personal integrity—of pretending that the status quo is acceptable. And when the cost of pretending becomes intolerably high for a few citizens, sudden and surprising mass protests can erupt. The actions of these few can trigger similar actions by others, who, when they see how many others feel as they do and are willing to show it publicly, join in the opposition. The larger the number of protestors becomes, the more others are willing to join them. <strong>loc</strong> 1309 Note: critical mass?</li>
<li>settle. Officials in the ruling party, the executive branch, and the security services have an enormous stake in the status quo and will try to preserve it. <strong>loc</strong> 1321</li>
<li>Although demonstrators did not articulate specific demands beyond Ben Ali’s departure, cosmetic changes to the state are not likely to be enough to satisfy most Tunisians today. <strong>loc</strong> 1329</li>
<li>For a generation, Ben Ali suffocated the political arena to such a degree that there is no force capable of governing Tunisia other than the ruling party and the military. The country’s handful of legal opposition parties has not been allowed to develop real constituencies and nationwide organizational structures. And the members of the Tunisian Islamist movement—which, for better or worse, constituted a real political alternative in the 1980s and early 1990s—are in no position to govern. Many of these Islamists have adopted more moderate views that could make them an attractive force, but these figures have been in exile for years. <strong>loc</strong> 1332</li>
<li>Rulers of Arab countries whose political systems most resemble Tunisia’s—the secular single-party authoritarian republics of Egypt and Syria—undoubtedly watched Ben Ali’s fall with knots in their stomachs. Internet users and bloggers throughout the region reveled in what Tunisian protestors had achieved, calling for copycat actions elsewhere. <strong>loc</strong> 1338</li>
<li>many Arab regimes enjoy Western support due to their moderate stances toward Israel, oil resources, assistance in the war on terror, and the fact that they face powerful domestic Islamist opponents whom Western governments are not eager to see take power. <strong>loc</strong> 1347</li>
<li>For Washington, the quick fall of Ben Ali is a reminder that stability can be deceptive. Although it is necessary to work with existing, if unsavory, regimes to advance regional objectives, it is impossible to predict when these regimes’ hold on power may unravel. And when it does, the absence of strong political institutions that are capable of managing transition can lead to a climate of dangerous instability. Atrophied, disorganized opposition groups make achieving stability even more difficult. Thus, although it may be a delicate and difficult task, the United States should encourage the development of stronger, more autonomous political institutions, as well as credible alternative power centers within its authoritarian allies. <strong>loc</strong> 1353 Note: interesting note</li>

<li><p>Letter from Cairo The People’s Military in Egypt? Eric Trager FOREIGNAFFAIRS.COM, JANUARY 30, 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 1359</p>

<ul>
<li>Mubarak took important steps toward mending it when he appointed Omar Suleiman, a former general and security chief, as his vice president, and Ahmed Shafik, a former air chief of staff, as his prime minister. <strong>loc</strong> 1377</li>
<li>The police, after all, have been the most frequent point of contact between the people and the regime, and they are famously corrupt and abusive. Operating under the Ministry of the Interior, the police include the Central Security Forces, who beat protesters all last week and blanketed Cairo in a cloud of tear gas on Friday; and State Security, which is responsible for monitoring and disrupting all political opposition activity through a vast system of informants. Meanwhile, to handle the messiest of anti-dissident jobs, the police frequently hire balpagiya—literally, gangsters, who are paid by the police to mete out punishment without dirtying the government’s hands. <strong>loc</strong> 1382</li>
<li>The army is thus portrayed as a proud, patriotic institution that is always on the side of the people. <strong>loc</strong> 1394</li>
<li>the army’s quasi-mythic status within Egyptian society can be explained by severe government restrictions on criticizing it. The army, after all, is the backbone of the regime, and attacking it is as forbidden as attacking Mubarak himself. <strong>loc</strong> 1398</li>
<li>the police state that the protesters so furiously decry has nearly been the first line of defense for Egypt’s military regime. So there is good reason to believe that, with the police state having been peeled away, the military will emerge as a target of criticism. <strong>loc</strong> 1404</li>
<li>The longer that the military serves as the primary enforcer of Mubarak’s strict curfews, the faster its goodwill will evaporate. And this could have serious repercussions for its ability to control the politics of any transition. <strong>loc</strong> 1420</li>
<li>The U.S.-Egyptian Breakup Washington’s Limited Options in Cairo Steven A. Cook FOREIGNAFFAIRS.COM, FEBRUARY 2, 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 1432</li>
<li>The United States was not responsible for the inequity of Mubarak’s rule, but it did enable and benefit from it. <strong>loc</strong> 1450</li>
<li>For the United States, Mubarak was pivotal in creating a regional order that made it easier and less expensive for Washington to pursue its interests, from the free flow of oil to the protection of Israel and the prevention of any one country in the region from becoming too dominant. The benefits to Mubarak were clear: approximately $70 billion in economic and military aid over 30 years and the ostensible prestige of being a partner of the world’s superpower. <strong>loc</strong> 1461</li>
<li>Mubarak thus faced two irreconcilable positions: he could either be Washington’s man or a man of the people—but not both. He chose the former and tried to fill in the resulting legitimacy gap with manipulation and force. <strong>loc</strong> 1469</li>
<li>The United States should greatly lower its expectations of what is possible in the post-Mubarak era and come to terms with the end of the strategic relationship. Expecting the new Egyptian president—whoever that may be—to carry on a partnership with Washington is like Václav Havel asking the Soviets for assistance after Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution in 1989. To be sure, there are no Havels in Egypt, and Washington is not Soviet-era Moscow—but the analogy rings true enough for those people in Cairo’s Tahrir Square or the Alexandria corniche who saw U.S.-made F-16s fly overhead or were choked by tear gas produced in the United States. <strong>loc</strong> 1481 Note: how does this hold up?</li>
<li>Washington does not occupy Egypt, but it risks playing a malevolent role in the transition if it tries to interfere. The United States should learn the lessons of the past, stand aside, and let the Egyptians pick up where they left off when the Free Officers took over. <strong>loc</strong> 1506</li>

<ul>
<li>Although the Brotherhood entered the political system in order to change it, it ended up being changed by the system. Leaders who were elected to professional syndicates engaged in sustained dialogue and cooperation with members of other political movements, including secular Arab nationalists. Through such interactions, Islamists and Arabists found common ground in the call for an expansion of public freedoms, democracy, and respect for human rights and the rule of law, all of which, they admitted, their movements had neglected in the past. <strong>loc</strong> 1539</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite the tenacity, optimism, and blood of the protesters massed in Tahrir Square, Egypt’s democratic window has probably already closed. <strong>loc</strong> 1606</li>
<li>the country’s central institution, the military, which historically has influenced policy and commands near-monopolistic economic interests, has never balked. <strong>loc</strong> 1611</li>
<li>Despite the fact that a general with a megaphone stated his solidarity with the protesters while other protesters painted “Down to Mubarak” on tanks across central Cairo, no acts of organizational fragmentation or dissent within the chain of command have occurred. <strong>loc</strong> 1616</li>
<li>By politically encircling the protesters, the regime prevented the conflict from extending beyond its grasp. With the protesters caught between regime-engineered violence and regime-manufactured safety, the cabinet generals remained firmly in control of the situation. <strong>loc</strong> 1636</li>
<li>Banks have been closed since January 27, ATMs have been emptied of their cash, and the prices of food and staples have slowly risen at a time when school is cancelled, offices are closed, and curfews are in effect. Similarly, the Internet and cellular networks were shut off and have been patchy at best since their return. <strong>loc</strong> 1640</li>
<li>People are tired of being cooped up in their apartments, made anxious as their stockpiles of food and money decrease, and they are ready for a sense of “normalcy” to return. Ironically, the normalcy they pine for resembles the police state so many tried to banish just thirteen days ago. This method of wearing down the non-protesting public seems just as strategic as the violence employed on those airing their grievances in the streets. <strong>loc</strong> 1643</li>
<li>the fact that the Egyptian regime has played a goodcop, bad-cop routine to contain the situation remains lost in the din of 24-hour coverage. <strong>loc</strong> 1648</li>
<li>If those guiding the transition choose to direct it toward a democratic end, then it will have to include forces that are currently banned in the country, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, and individuals who have been tortured or imprisoned, such as Ayman Nour. <strong>loc</strong> 1654</li>
<li>The leader of the transition will therefore determine whether it results in a genuine democracy or continuous authoritarian rule. If that person is General Omar Suleiman, who was sworn in as vice president on January 30, the prospects for democracy are grim. <strong>loc</strong> 1657</li>
<li>When the uprising began in Egypt, many linked the events in Tunis and Cairo and declared that 2011 might be the Arab world’s 1989. Instead, 2011 is showing just how durable and adaptable the authoritarian regimes of the Arab world truly are. <strong>loc</strong> 1679 Note: how does thus hold up now?</li>

<li>The instinctive and expected Israeli reaction to the upheaval in Egypt has been to try to preserve the status quo for as long as possible while planning a defense budget increase.

<li>the real concern is that the regime will only shed its corrupt civilians, leaving its military component as the only player left standing. <strong>loc</strong> 1791</li>
<li>Popular revolt erupted between 1975 and 1977 over the government’s economic policies. To regain control, the military turned its attention away from war and toward development. It gradually withdrew from direct control over politics, ceding power to domestic security forces and the other powerful backer of Egypt’s ruling party—small groups of civilian businessmen who benefited from their privileged access to government sales and purchases to expand their own fortunes. <strong>loc</strong> 1804</li>
<li>Throughout the 1990s, the army expanded its involvement in the economy. By this decade, industries owned by the military were estimated to control 5 to 20 percent of the entire Egyptian economy; likewise, army officers receive a variety of benefits, such as special preference in access to goods and services. <strong>loc</strong> 1813</li>
<li>The practical demands of the protesters seem fairly simple: end the state of emergency, hold new elections, and grant the freedom to form parties without state interference. But these demands would amount to opening up the political space to everyone across Egypt’s social and political structure. That would involve constitutional and statutory changes, such as reforming Egypt as a parliamentary rather than a presidential system, in which a freely elected majority selects the prime minister (who is now appointed by the president). These changes would wipe away the power structure the army created in 1952 and has backed since. <strong>loc</strong> 1818</li>

<ul>
<li>Egypt was ripe for revolution; dramatic change would have come at some point in the next few years, even absent the spark of Tunisia or the existence of social media. <strong>loc</strong> 1859</li>
<li>social media are a significant factor, but their role has been exaggerated. It is hardly the first disruptive technology to come along: the printing press, telegraph, telephone, radio, television, and cassettes all posed challenges to the existing order of their day. And like these earlier technologies, social media are not decisive: they can be repressed by governments as well as employed by governments to motivate their supporters. <strong>loc</strong> 1860</li>
<li>The initial success of revolutions is determined less by the strength of the protesters than by the will and cohesion of the regime. Tunisia’s collapse came quickly, because its president lost his nerve and the army was weak and unwilling to stand by him. Egypt’s establishment and its military are demonstrating far greater resolve. <strong>loc</strong> 1866</li>
<li>Revolutionary movements invariably split into factions. Their sole common objective is the ouster of the existing regime. As soon as this goal comes close to being achieved, elements of the opposition begin to position themselves for the second phase of the struggle and the coming competition for power. <strong>loc</strong> 1881 Note: stages of revolution</li>

<ul>
<li>The popular uprisings that swept Egypt and Tunisia this winter were remarkably similar, but their immediate outcomes have been quite different. In Tunisia, civilian politicians and technocrats quickly took the helm of the country in the wake of the revolution. In Egypt, by contrast, the military’s Supreme Council is slated to rule the nation for six months, and whether it stays in power or returns to the barracks, it will surely try to ensure that civilians do not subordinate its role in politics. Given the nature and history of the two countries’ militaries, this divergence is not surprising. <strong>loc</strong> 2082</li>
<li>With merely 50,000 in uniform, the army, as a proportion of the population, is among the smallest in the Arab world. Denied significant amounts of the foreign assistance that came into Tunisia, undersupplied, poorly equipped, and excluded from Ben Ali’s patronage network, it was not invested in the regime. <strong>loc</strong> 2090</li>
<li>U.S. involvement with the military, Ben Ali supposed, would prevent the French from having a monopoly of influence over his country’s means of coercion. At the same time, it meant that the army, which already had little loyalty to Ben Ali and no economic interest in maintaining his regime, became the one well-trained and highly professional force in the country. <strong>loc</strong> 2094</li>
<li>when Ben Ali ordered the Tunisian army’s chief of staff, Rachid Ammar, to fire on the protesters as the Jasmine Revolution gained momentum, the general refused. Likewise, Ben Ali’s order to dismiss Ammar was ignored. The military instead turned its guns on the security and intelligence forces and the gangs of hooligans that Ben Ali loyalists had sent into the streets to sow panic. <strong>loc</strong> 2098</li>
<li>Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt was a military state to which the police were subordinate. <strong>loc</strong> 2103</li>
<li>the Egyptian military was allowed—indeed encouraged—to develop its own economic empire, which alleviated some of the institution’s expenses for the government and, more important, generated a patronage network to buy the loyalty of the officer corps. <strong>loc</strong> 2105</li>
<li>Although its size and strength are widely recognized, the Egyptian army is not the tight professional force that many consider it to be. It is bloated and its officer core is indulged, having been fattened on Mubarak’s patronage. Its training is desultory, maintenance of its equipment is profoundly inadequate, and it is dependent on the United States for funding and logistical support. But even weapons systems the United States has given the Egyptian army, such as F-16s and M1A1 tanks, are underutilized. Many are also comparatively ineffective, in part because Minister of Defense Muhammad Tantawi, acting on behalf of Mubarak, denied them vital, state-of-the-art communication capacities. He did so to impede lateral communications within the officer corps and to prevent interoperability with nominally allied forces, including those of friendly Arab countries. The raison d’être of the military was always to support the Mubarak regime, not defend the nation. <strong>loc</strong> 2113</li>

<li>The immediate trigger for the outbreak of protests in Egypt was the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia in mid-January, which demonstrated that sustained and broad-based popular mobilization can lead to political change, even in a police state such as Tunisia. But other factors had long been at work in Egyptian politics and society. In particular, Mubarak’s downfall was the result of three factors: increasing corruption and economic exclusion, the alienation of the youth, and the 2010 elections and divisions among the Egyptian elite over questions of succession. <strong>loc</strong> 2163</li>
<li>the 1950s and 1960s, the Nasser regime, which was at once authoritarian and populist, forged a ruling bargain with labor and the middle class. All political parties were banned and all civil-society organizations, including trade unions, came under the direct control of the regime. In return, the state provided social and welfare services in the form of government employment; subsidies for food, energy, housing, and transportation; and free education and health care. <strong>loc</strong> 2173</li>
<li>In the early 1990s, a looming economic crisis caused by unsustainable levels of external debt forced Mubarak’s government to sign an agreement on economic reform with the World Bank. Over the next two decades, the Egyptian government undertook a series of structural adjustments to the economy that reduced spending on social programs; liberalized trade, commodity prices, and interest rates; suspended the longtime guarantee of government employment for university graduates; privatized a number of public-sector companies; and suspended subsidies for many commodities. As state expenditures declined, public spending on social services—including education, health care, transportation, and housing—stagnated, and the quality of these services deteriorated. <strong>loc</strong> 2177</li>
<li>Factory workers, landless peasants, government employees, and those who produce goods for the local market (as opposed to for export) suffered most. <strong>loc</strong> 2183</li>
<li>At the same time, a new Egyptian business elite emerged: some people exploited the period of economic reform and openness to turn their contacts with the regime and international markets into vast fortunes. <strong>loc</strong> 2185</li>
<li>there soon emerged a two-tiered society: the majority of the Egyptian population was increasingly marginalized, while a small minority prospered like never before. <strong>loc</strong> 2187</li>

<li>Egypt, like much of the Middle East, is in the middle of a dramatic and growing youth bulge. Today, more than half the total population of the Arab countries is under the age of 30; in Egypt, more than one-third of the population is between 15 and 29. <strong>loc</strong> 2198</li>
<li>Youth unemployment is highest among those with more education: <strong>loc</strong> 2202</li>
<li>This combination of high unemployment and low pay has kept many young Egyptian men from marrying and forming families. Approximately half of all Egyptian men between the ages of 25 and 29 are not married. <strong>loc</strong> 2204</li>
<li>after the state’s harsh persecution of Islamists in the 1990s, youth activists began to express their grievances through a new generation of protest movements open to members of all ideological backgrounds and to those without any particular ideology at all. <strong>loc</strong> 2211</li>
<li>Kefaya, which has attracted legions of previously apolitical youth. In 2004 and 2005, it organized a series of high-profile protests calling for the end of Mubarak’s presidency and the country’s emergency law. In 2008, youth activists from Kefaya formed the April 6 Movement in solidarity with textile workers who were planning a strike for that date. The movement attracted 70,000 members on Facebook, making it the largest youth movement in Egypt at the time. Members of both the April 6 Movement and Kefaya were behind the creation of another popular Facebook group, one supporting Mohamed El Baradei, the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who returned to Egypt in February 2010. <strong>loc</strong> 2213</li>
<li>Perhaps the most important Facebook group would arise some months later when, in June 2010, activists associated with the El Baradei campaign created a Facebook page called “We are all Khaled Said” in memory of a young man who was beaten to death by police officers in Alexandria. Their page attracted more than one million supporters and became the focal point for a number of large protests against state abuses in the summer of 2010. By the end of 2010, Egypt’s youth activists had succeeded in bypassing many of the long-standing constraints on political and civic life in the country. <strong>loc</strong> 2218 Note: movements on Facebook</li>
<li>These underlying forces in turn spurred on the groups that participated in the mass protests in January and February: youth movements, labor groups, and the political parties that were excluded from joining parliament in 2010, including the Muslim Brotherhood. <strong>loc</strong> 2243</li>
<li>these activists formed the Coalition of January 25 Youth to present a series of demands to the regime: the resignation of Mubarak, the lifting of the state of emergency, the release of all political prisoners, the dissolution of parliament, the appointment of a government of independent technocrats, the drafting of a new constitution, and the punishment of those responsible for violence against the protesters. <strong>loc</strong> 2246</li>
<li>For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood threw its full weight behind the protests but purposefully kept a low profile. Its young members were an integral part of the coalition that had organized the protests, and according to some of the organizers, Brotherhood supporters constituted about one-third of the crowd occupying Tahrir Square. Muslim Brothers made up a large share of the protesters in those cities where the group has long had a large following, such as Alexandria and El Mansura. However, throughout the protests, the Brotherhood was careful not to use religious slogans or to overshadow the secular, pro-democracy activists who were driving the demonstrations. <strong>loc</strong> 2260</li>
<li>In the two days preceding Mubarak’s resignation, the country was approaching a state of total civil disobedience, with workers striking en masse in the transportation, communications, and industrial sectors. Judges, doctors, university professors, lawyers, journalists, and artists also organized protests. According to Shady El Ghazaly Harb, a leading Egyptian youth activist, it was this development that finally convinced the military to oust Mubarak and assume control. <strong>loc</strong> 2267</li>
<li>In the end, it was the unity of the opposition and broad-based popular mobilization that forced the military to oust Mubarak. <strong>loc</strong> 2275</li>
<li>Throughout the crisis, the protesters had welcomed the presence of the military on the streets and urged it to side with them against Mubarak, as the military had done in Tunisia just weeks earlier. But until the last days of the crisis, the military seemed to back Mubarak’s plan to remain in power until September and oversee an orderly transition to democracy. It took new groups joining the protests and the rising prospect of a confrontation between the protesters and the presidential guard for the military to finally break with Mubarak. <strong>loc</strong> 2286</li>
<li>On February 10, a spokesperson for the High Council of the Armed Forces delivered a communiqué that stated that the council supported the legitimate demands of the people. <strong>loc</strong> 2290</li>
<li>There are fears that if the first scenario prevails, the democratic revolution will be aborted and the old regime—under the guise of NDP loyalists in an alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood—will reassert itself. <strong>loc</strong> 2314 Note: did this happen?</li>

<li><p>The Black Swan of Cairo How Suppressing Volatility Makes the World Less Predictable and More Dangerous Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Mark Blyth FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 2321</p>

<ul>
<li>What the world is witnessing in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya is simply what happens when highly constrained systems explode. <strong>loc</strong> 2334 Note: boom</li>
<li>Complex systems that have artificially suppressed volatility tend to become extremely fragile, while at the same time exhibiting no visible risks. In fact, they tend to be too calm and exhibit minimal variability as silent risks accumulate beneath the surface. <strong>loc</strong> 2335</li>
<li>These artificially constrained systems become prone to “Black Swans”— that is, they become extremely vulnerable to large-scale events that lie far from the statistical norm and were largely unpredictable to a given set of observers. <strong>loc</strong> 2338</li>
<li>it is the same misperception of the properties of natural systems that led to both the economic crisis of 2007–8 and the current turmoil in the Arab world. <strong>loc</strong> 2344 Note: new(ish) stance on topic</li>
<li>Just as a robust economic system is one that encourages early failures (the concepts of “fail small” and “fail fast”), the U.S. government should stop supporting dictatorial regimes for the sake of pseudostability and instead allow political noise to rise to the surface. Making an economy robust in the face of business swings requires allowing risk to be visible; the same is true in politics. <strong>loc</strong> 2347</li>
<li>Both the recent financial crisis and the current political crisis in the Middle East are grounded in the rise of complexity, interdependence, and unpredictability. <strong>loc</strong> 2351 Note: agreed</li>
<li>grave delayed side effects. <strong>loc</strong> 2364 Note: this section is terrifying</li>
<li>Because policymakers believed it was better to do something than to do nothing, they felt obligated to heal the economy rather than wait and see if it healed on its own. The foreign policy equivalent is to support the incumbent no matter what. <strong>loc</strong> 2364 Note: helpful analogy</li>
<li>client governments such as Hosni Mubarak’s in Egypt for years engaged in overt plunder thanks to similarly reliable U.S. support. <strong>loc</strong> 2367</li>
<li>Those who seek to prevent volatility on the grounds that any and all bumps in the road must be avoided paradoxically increase the probability that a tail risk will cause a major explosion. <strong>loc</strong> 2369</li>
<li>The risks of a dictatorship, no matter how seemingly stable, are no different, in the long run, from those of an artificially controlled price. <strong>loc</strong> 2375</li>
<li>humans must work with nature by tolerating systems that absorb human imperfections rather than seek to change them. <strong>loc</strong> 2379</li>
<li>Humans simultaneously inhabit two systems: the linear and the complex. The linear domain is characterized by its predictability and the low degree of interaction among its components, which allows the use of mathematical methods that make forecasts reliable. In complex systems, there is an absence of visible causal links between the elements, masking a high degree of interdependence and extremely low predictability. <strong>loc</strong> 2396</li>
<li>It would be foolish to blame the collapse on the last grain of sand rather than the structure of the pile, but that is what people do consistently, and that is the policy error. <strong>loc</strong> 2400 Note: Interesting consideration re: tipping point theories</li>
<li>it is the suppressed risk in the statistical tails that matters—not the failure to see the last grain of sand. As a result of complicated interdependence and contagion effects, in all man-made complex systems, a small number of possible events dominate, namely, Black Swans. <strong>loc</strong> 2404 Note: Remember this term when writing post on background</li>
<li>Complex systems are misunderstood, mostly because humans’ sophistication, obtained over the history of human knowledge in the linear domain, does not transfer properly to the complex domain. <strong>loc</strong> 2408</li>
<li>Humans can predict a solar eclipse and the trajectory of a space vessel, but not the stock market or Egyptian political events. <strong>loc</strong> 2410 Note: Nice potential quote</li>
<li>The system is responsible, not the components. <strong>loc</strong> 2414 Note: Remember this.</li>
<li>the illusion of local causal chains—that is, confusing catalysts for causes and assuming that one can know which catalyst will produce which effect. <strong>loc</strong> 2418</li>
<li>Governments are wasting billions of dollars on attempting to predict events that are produced by interdependent systems and are therefore not statistically understandable at the individual level. <strong>loc</strong> 2420 Note: I tend to agree</li>
<li>Political and economic “tail events” are unpredictable, and their probabilities are not scientifically measurable. <strong>loc</strong> 2427</li>
<li>Most explanations being offered for the current turmoil in the Middle East follow the “catalysts as causes” confusion. The riots in Tunisia and Egypt were initially attributed to rising commodity prices, not to stifling and unpopular dictatorships. But Bahrain and Libya are countries with high GDPs that can afford to import grain and other commodities. <strong>loc</strong> 2429 Note: Good point</li>
<li>It is the system and its fragility, not events, that must be studied—what physicists call “percolation theory,” in which the properties of the terrain are studied rather than those of a single element of the terrain. <strong>loc</strong> 2432 Note: Theory of cause</li>
<li>Differentiating between two types of countries is useful. In the first, changes in government do not lead to meaningful differences in political outcomes (since political tensions are out in the open). In the second type, changes in government lead to both drastic and deeply unpredictable changes. <strong>loc</strong> 2435</li>
<li>Switching equilibrium, with control of the government changing from one party to another, in such systems acts as a shock absorber. Since a single party cannot have total and more than temporary control, the possibility of a large jump in the regime type is constrained. <strong>loc</strong> 2442</li>
<li>that the more constrained the volatility, the bigger the regime jump is likely to be. From the French Revolution to the triumph of the Bolsheviks, history is replete with such examples, and yet somehow humans remain unable to process what they mean. <strong>loc</strong> 2449</li>
<li>alongside the “catalysts as causes” confusion sit two mental biases: the illusion of control and the action bias (the illusion that doing something is always better than doing nothing). <strong>loc</strong> 2456</li>
<li>Variation is information. When there is no variation, there is no information. <strong>loc</strong> 2460</li>
<li>rather than subsidize and praise as a “force for stability” every tin-pot potentate on the planet, the U.S. government should encourage countries to let information flow upward through the transparency that comes with political agitation. <strong>loc</strong> 2462</li>
<li>The imposition of peace through repeated punishment lies at the heart of many seemingly intractable conflicts, including the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate. <strong>loc</strong> 2467 Note: eye for an eye?</li>
<li>dealing with seemingly reliable high-level officials rather than the people themselves prevents any peace treaty signed from being robust. <strong>loc</strong> 2468</li>
<li>Treaties that are negotiated with the consent of a broad swath of the populations on both sides of a conflict tend to survive. <strong>loc</strong> 2470</li>
<li>wrong. The West and its autocratic Arab allies have strengthened Islamic fundamentalists by forcing them underground, and even more so by killing them. <strong>loc</strong> 2475 Note: strong statement</li>
<li>With freedom comes some unpredictable fluctuation. This is one of life’s packages: there is no freedom without noise—and no stability without volatility. <strong>loc</strong> 2478 Note: good quote</li>

<li><p>Let Them Eat Bread How Food Subsidies Prevent (and Provoke) Revolutions in the Middle East Annia Ciezadlo FOREIGNAFFAIRS.COM, MARCH 23, 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 3411</p>

<ul>
<li>the region once known as the Fertile Crescent is now the world’s most dependent on imported grain. Of the top 20 wheat importers for 2010, almost half are Middle Eastern countries. The list reads like a playbook of toppled and teetering regimes: Egypt (1), Algeria (4), Iraq (7), Morocco (8), Yemen (13), Saudi Arabia (15), Libya (16), Tunisia (17). <strong>loc</strong> 3425</li>
<li>dimuqratiyyat al-Khubz, or “democracy of bread.” <strong>loc</strong> 3429</li>
<li>when a government puts those things out of reach for the majority of its citizens, using handouts or subsidies as a substitute for democratic or economic reforms, bread becomes a powerful symbol of all they cannot have. <strong>loc</strong> 3434</li>
<li>the very commodity that Arab regimes once used to ensure obedience has now become a symbol and source of defiance. <strong>loc</strong> 3436</li>
<li>the cheap wheat came at a high cost: unemployment. The dependence on foreign largesse, coupled with the low price of global grains, encouraged many Middle Eastern regimes to hollow out their agricultural sectors. <strong>loc</strong> 3453</li>
<li>Encouraged by the IMF and the World Bank to lift tariffs and import bans, and discouraged (or even restricted) from investing in their own agricultural sectors, they went from being net agricultural exporters to net importers—especially of subsidized American wheat. <strong>loc</strong> 3455</li>
<li>In 1960, Egypt was producing enough wheat to be almost self-sufficient; by 2010, it was importing roughly half the country’s total intake (nine billion tons), making it by far the biggest wheat importer in the world. <strong>loc</strong> 3457</li>
<li>As expensive as they are, bread subsidies do not succeed in lifting people out of poverty; in fact, by discouraging domestic agricultural investment, they have often hurt the very people they are intended to help. <strong>loc</strong> 3462</li>

<li>on April 6, 2008, tens of thousands of students, unemployed Egyptians, and textile workers in the textile-mill town of Al-Mahalla al-Kubra staged a protest against unemployment, high food prices, and widespread police torture. Young protesters broadcast cell phone videos of the uprising on Facebook and YouTube, which helped spread the protests to other parts of Egypt. Eventually, the youth activists coalesced into the April 6 Movement, named after the Al-Mahalla al-Kubra uprising, which in turn grew into the revolt that would eventually topple Mubarak. <strong>loc</strong> 3475</li>

<li>The region is facing a demographic bulge in which youth aged fifteen to twenty-nine comprise the largest proportion of the population. These young people, frustrated with lack of jobs, have been at the forefront of anti-government protests. <strong>loc</strong> 3515</li>
<li>When you have people whose expectations have risen because of their education, and then these expectations are shattered, they become very angry and dangerous to the regimes. <strong>loc</strong> 3532</li>
<li>Governments have to devise political systems that allow these youth to be represented, to have a voice in the running of their country. And they have to devise economic systems that make good use of these productive resources that the youth potentially are. <strong>loc</strong> 3553</li>
<li>There needs to be international agreements to regulate migrant flows. We need to strengthen international organizations for migration.

<li><p>Our Bargain With the New Gadhafi Elliott Abrams WALL STREET JOURNAL, FEBRUARY 25, 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 3669</p>

<ul>
<li>After the U.S. Army made short shrift of Saddam Hussein’s forces in 2003, Gadhafi approached British intelligence and sought to come in from the cold. He agreed, after negotiations conducted largely by the CIA and London’s MI6, to abandon terrorism and hand over to the U.S. his programs for developing missiles and weapons of mass destruction. <strong>loc</strong> 3682</li>
<li>In exchange, the U.S. sent an ambassador to Tripoli and allowed Libya to open an embassy in Washington. <strong>loc</strong> 3687</li>
<li>All sanctions ended. The U.S. stopped blocking Libyan efforts to join United Nations committees, and in 2008 Libya served for a month as president of the Security Council. <strong>loc</strong> 3689</li>
<li>The U.S. also restrained its criticism of Gadhafi’s internal repression. The agreement with Gadhafi came in 2003, the same year that President George W. Bush delivered his speech at the National Endowment for Democracy saying that “Sixty years of Western nations excusing and accommodating the lack of freedom in the Middle East did nothing to make us safe— because in the long run, stability cannot be purchased at the expense of liberty.” <strong>loc</strong> 3691</li>
<li>Our annual human rights reports told the truth, but there was no question that the Bush administration (and the Obama administration that followed) felt limited by Gadhafi’s adherence to the bargain. <strong>loc</strong> 3698</li>
<li>We were doing business with Gadhafi, not trying to overthrow him. <strong>loc</strong> 3700</li>
<li>Gadhafi has established no national institutions, not even allowing a fake parliament of the Mubarak or Ben Ali variety that could perhaps be turned into something real. <strong>loc</strong> 3709</li>
<li>Gadhafi, who took power in a military coup, was too clever to allow a well-organized army that might do the same to him. Many units are organized along tribal lines, which has kept Gadhafi safe but may be his undoing now. <strong>loc</strong> 3712</li>

<li><p>Libya’s Terra Incognita Who and What Will Follow Qaddafi? Frederic Wehrey FOREIGNAFFAIRS.COM, FEBRUARY 28, 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 3718</p>

<ul>
<li>Libya lacks both legitimate formal institutions and a functioning civil society. The new, post-Qaddafi era, therefore, is likely to be marked by the emergence of long-suppressed domestic groups jostling for supremacy in what is sure to be a chaotic political scene. <strong>loc</strong> 3725</li>
<li>Some of the most senior officers—among them even those who supported Qaddafi in the 1969 coup—were forced into early retirement after the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings to prevent them from leading any opposition. <strong>loc</strong> 3746</li>
<li>Although the Qaddafi regime was, at least in theory, opposed to tribal identity, its longevity depended in large measure on a shaky coalition among three principal tribes: the al-Qaddadfa, al-Magariha, and al-Warfalla. <strong>loc</strong> 3751</li>
<li>the weakness and fragmentation of the military and the tempting availability of oil resources highlight the very real threat of tribal warlordism. <strong>loc</strong> 3758</li>
<li>Among Libya’s Islamists, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group has long attracted the attention of the West because of its association with al Qaeda. But after Qaddafi, the less visible, non-Salafi networks will matter more—namely, the Sufi orders and the Muslim Brotherhood. <strong>loc</strong> 3761</li>
<li>The two regions are divided by linguistic and cultural differences, as well as a vast stretch of desert. The east shares tribal ties with Egypt and even the Arabian Peninsula rather than with the Maghreb. After toppling the monarchy, Qaddafi shifted political power and economic resources to Tripoli, which further exacerbated the regional divide. <strong>loc</strong> 3770</li>
<li>In post-Qaddafi Libya, Cyrenaica will be tempted to reassert its historic primacy. For starters, the area produces the country’s oil wealth. It also bears the proud legacy of having led not one but two resistance struggles: the anti-Italian guerrilla campaign under the direction of the Sufi leader Omar al-Mukhtar and now the February 17 “Day of Rage,” which was christened by its organizers—not accidentally—as the Mukhtar Revolution. The sparsely populated and ill-governed southern periphery will also contend for resources and influence in the new state. Non-Arab ethnic groups with transnational ties across the Sahel and Saharan belt—the Amazigh (Berbers), Tuareg, and Toubou—were marginalized under Qaddafi. <strong>loc</strong> 3772</li>

<ul>
<li>when foreigners seek to liberate a country whose people have been unable to liberate themselves, they often fall into one or more of three traps. First, the leadership that replaces the former regime finds that it cannot rule because it has not been able to mobilize the support to win on its own, and, as in Iraq, civil strife follows the liberating invasion. The new leadership finds itself in the second trap when it can only remain in power thanks to ongoing foreign support. As a result, it renders the country a client state rather than a free nation. The third trap occurs when the leadership learns that it can only govern as the previous dictator did—by force. The liberating invaders are thus responsible not only for the monetary and human costs of the invasion but for having produced a civil war, a colony, or one more tyranny with a new ideological label attached. <strong>loc</strong> 3924</li>

<li><p>Demystifying the Arab Spring Parsing the Differences Between Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya Lisa Anderson FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 4644 Note: well well!</p>

<ul>
<li>Egyptians rose in revolt as strikes across the country brought daily life to a halt and toppled the government. In Libya, provincial leaders worked feverishly to strengthen their newly independent republic. It was 1919. That year’s events demonstrate that the global diffusion of information and expectations—so vividly on display in Tahrir Square this past winter—is not a result of the Internet and social media. <strong>loc</strong> 4649 Note: stance on role of social media</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The Egyptian Facebook campaigners are the modern incarnation of Arab nationalist networks whose broadsheets disseminated strategies for civil disobedience throughout the region in the years after World War I. <strong>loc</strong> 4655</p>

<ul>
<li>the critical issue is how and why these ambitions and techniques resonated in their various local contexts. <strong>loc</strong> 4659</li>
<li>The demonstrations in Tunisia spiraled toward the capital from the neglected rural areas, finding common cause with a once powerful but much repressed labor movement. In Egypt, by contrast, urbane and cosmopolitan young people in the major cities organized the uprisings. Meanwhile, in Libya, ragtag bands of armed rebels in the eastern provinces ignited the protests, revealing the tribal and regional cleavages that have beset the country for decades. <strong>loc</strong> 4660 Note: patterns and demographics</li>
<li>Although they shared a common call for personal dignity and responsive government, the revolutions across these three countries reflected divergent economic grievances and social dynamics—legacies of their diverse encounters with modern Europe and decades under unique regimes. <strong>loc</strong> 4663</li>
<li>As a result, Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya face vastly different challenges moving forward. Tunisians will need to grapple with the class divisions manifesting themselves in the country’s continuing political unrest. Egyptians must redesign their institutions of government. And Libyans will need to recover from a bloody civil war. For the United States to fulfill its goals in the region, it will need to understand these distinctions and distance itself from the idea that the Tunisian, Egyptian, and Libyan uprisings constitute a cohesive Arab revolt. <strong>loc</strong> 4666</li>
<li>Former Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali—the first Arab dictator to fall to mass protests—initially seemed an unlikely victim. <strong>loc</strong> 4675 Note: background on tunisia</li>
<li>Tunisia’s government institutions were relatively healthy, raising the prospects for a clean, efficient, and technocratic government to replace Ben Ali. <strong>loc</strong> 4686</li>
<li>Tunisia’s military also played a less significant role in the country’s revolt than the armed forces in the other nations experiencing unrest. <strong>loc</strong> 4688</li>
<li>the military has not participated meaningfully in managing the transition period and is unlikely to shape the ultimate outcome in any significant way. <strong>loc</strong> 4691</li>
<li>Since Tunisia’s protests initiated the wave of unrest in the Arab world, they were more spontaneous and less well organized than subsequent campaigns in other nations. <strong>loc</strong> 4693</li>
<li>Tunisia’s new leadership must therefore incorporate a generation of young people with only theoretical exposure to freedom of belief, expression, and assembly into a system that fosters open political debate and contestation. And it must respond to some of the demands, especially of the labor movement, that will feature prominently in those debates. <strong>loc</strong> 4702</li>
<li>The government’s deteriorating ability to provide basic services and seeming indifference to widespread unemployment and poverty alienated tens of millions of Egyptians, a feeling that was exacerbated by growing conspicuous consumption among a business elite connected to Mubarak’s son Gamal. <strong>loc</strong> 4706</li>
<li>the army’s carefully calibrated intervention in the uprising indicated the continuing power of a military establishment honed by equal parts patronage and patriotism. And the protesters’ political and tactical sophistication came about as a result of Mubarak’s reluctant but real tolerance of a raucous and unruly press. <strong>loc</strong> 4708</li>
<li>the Egyptian army is widely respected by the general populace. It is also deeply interwoven into the domestic economy. <strong>loc</strong> 4714</li>
<li>The national police were widely reviled long before their brutal crackdowns at the inception of the January 25 revolt because they represented, in essence, a nationwide protection racket. <strong>loc</strong> 4721</li>
<li>But the remarkable discipline demonstrated by Egypt’s protesters and their subsequent wide-ranging debates about how to reshape their country speak to the unusually high tolerance for free expression in Egypt (by regional standards) prior to the revolution. <strong>loc</strong> 4726</li>
<li>Egypt has a culture of deep communal bonds and trust, which manifested itself in the demonstrators’ incredible discipline: their sustained nonviolence, their refusal to be provoked by thugs and saboteurs, their capacity to police themselves and coordinate their demands, and their ability to organize without any centralized leadership. <strong>loc</strong> 4733</li>
<li>Whereas demonstrators in Tunis and Cairo successfully ousted their former rulers, Tripoli collapsed into a protracted civil war. Its sustained fighting resulted from Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi’s four-decade-long effort to consolidate his power and rule by patronage to kin and clan. <strong>loc</strong> 4738</li>
<li>Libyan society has been fractured, and every national institution, including the military, is divided by the cleavages of kinship and region. As opposed to Tunisia and Egypt, Libya has no system of political alliances, network of economic associations, or national organizations of any kind. <strong>loc</strong> 4743</li>
<li>Qaddafi also prohibited private ownership and retail trade, banned a free press, and subverted the civil service and the military leadership. In the absence of any public-sector bureaucracy, including a reliable police force, kin networks have provided safety and security as well as access to goods and services. It was along such networks that Libyan society fractured when the regime’s capacity to divide and rule began to unravel at the beginning of the protests. <strong>loc</strong> 4748</li>
<li>This lack of social and governmental cohesion will hamper any prospective transition to democracy. Libya must first restore security and introduce the law and order missing for decades under Qaddafi’s regime. <strong>loc</strong> 4753</li>
<li>The challenge for Libya is both simpler and more vexing than those facing Tunisia and Egypt: Libya confronts the complexity not of democratization but of state formation. It will need to construct a coherent national identity and public administration out of Qaddafi’s shambles. <strong>loc</strong> 4758</li>
<li>The critical distinctions between Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya will shape the outcomes of their respective movements. While Tunisia and Egypt grapple in their own ways with building political institutions—constitutions, political parties, and electoral systems— Libya will need to begin by constructing the rudiments of a civil society. While Egypt struggles with the long shadow of military rule, Tunisia and Libya will need to redefine the relationship between their privileged capital cities and their sullen hinterlands. Tempting as it is to treat the Arab uprisings as a single movement, their causes and future missions demonstrate the many variations between them. <strong>loc</strong> 4763</li>
<li>If Washington hopes to fulfill its promise to support these rights, it will need to acquire a nuanced understanding of the historic circumstances of the uprisings. <strong>loc</strong> 4775 Note: agreed</li>
<li>the United States cannot pursue the goals so eloquently identified by Obama without discarding the notion of a singular Arab revolt and grappling with the conditions of the countries themselves. <strong>loc</strong> 4777</li>

<li><p>Understanding the Revolutions of 2011 Weakness and Resilience in Middle Eastern Autocracies Jack A. Goldstone FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 4779</p>

<ul>
<li>The revolutions of 2011 are fighting something quite different: “sultanistic” dictatorships. Although such regimes often appear unshakable, they are actually highly vulnerable, because the very strategies they use to stay in power make them brittle, not resilient. <strong>loc</strong> 4790</li>
<li>The government must appear so irremediably unjust or inept that it is widely viewed as a threat to the country’s future; elites (especially in the military) must be alienated from the state and no longer willing to defend it; a broad-based section of the population, spanning ethnic and religious groups and socioeconomic classes, must mobilize; and international powers must either refuse to step in to defend the government or constrain it from using maximum force to defend itself. <strong>loc</strong> 4794</li>
<li>To keep the masses depoliticized and unorganized, sultans control elections and political parties and pay their populations off; with subsidies for key goods, such as electricity, gasoline, and foodstuffs. When combined with surveillance, media control, and intimidation, these efforts generally ensure that citizens stay disconnected and passive. <strong>loc</strong> 4819</li>
<li>as the economy grows and education expands under a sultanistic dictator, the number of people with higher aspirations and a keener sensitivity to the intrusions of police surveillance and abuse increases. And if the entire population grows rapidly while the lion’s share of economic gains is hoarded by the elite, inequality and unemployment surge as well. <strong>loc</strong> 4833</li>
<li>By dividing their command structure, the sultan may reduce the threat they pose. But this strategy also makes the security forces more prone to defections in the event of mass protests. Lack of unity leads to splits within the security services; meanwhile, the fact that the regime is not backed by any appealing ideology or by independent institutions ensures that the military has less motivation to put down protests. <strong>loc</strong> 4851</li>
<li>The revolutions unfolding across the Middle East represent the breakdown of increasingly corrupt sultanistic regimes. Although economies across the region have grown in recent years, the gains have bypassed the majority of the population, being amassed instead by a wealthy few. <strong>loc</strong> 4871</li>
<li>In Tunisia, a 2008 U.S. diplomatic cable released by the whistleblower Web site WikiLeaks noted a spike in corruption, warning that Ben Ali’s family was becoming so predatory that new investment and job creation were being stifled and that his family’s ostentation was provoking widespread outrage. <strong>loc</strong> 4874</li>
<li>Fast-growing and urbanizing populations in the Middle East have been hurt by low wages and by food prices that rose by 32 percent in the last year alone, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. But it is not simply such rising prices, or a lack of growth, that fuels revolutions; it is the persistence of widespread and unrelieved poverty amid increasingly extravagant wealth. <strong>loc</strong> 4877</li>
<li>Discontent has also been stoked by high unemployment, which has stemmed in part from the surge in the Arab world’s young population. The percentage of young adults—those aged 15–29 as a fraction of all those over 15—ranges from 38 percent in Bahrain and Tunisia to over 50 percent in Yemen (compared to 26 percent in the United States). <strong>loc</strong> 4880</li>
<li>Since 1990, youth population aged 15–29 has grown by 50 percent in Libya and Tunisia, 65 percent in Egypt, and 125 percent in Yemen. <strong>loc</strong> 4883</li>
<li>Educated youth and workers in Tunisia and Egypt have been carrying out local protests and strikes for years to call attention to high unemployment, low wages, police harassment, and state corruption. This time, their protests combined and spread to other demographics. <strong>loc</strong> 4898</li>
<li>In both countries, military resentments made the military less likely to crack down on mass protests; officers and soldiers would not kill their countrymen just to keep the Ben Ali and Mubarak families and their favorites in power. <strong>loc</strong> 4906</li>
<li>A similar defection among factions of the Libyan military led to Qaddafi’s rapid loss of large territories. <strong>loc</strong> 4908</li>
<li>As conservatives, populists, Islamists, and modernizing reformers fiercely vie for power in Tunisia, Egypt, and perhaps Libya, those countries will likely face lengthy periods of abrupt government turnovers and policy reversals—similar to what occurred in the Philippines and many Eastern European countries after their revolutions. <strong>loc</strong> 4947</li>
<li>Tunisia and Egypt have intact economies with excellent recent growth records, but they need to build new democratic institutions. Pouring money into these countries before they have created accountable governments would only fuel corruption and undermine their progress toward democracy. <strong>loc</strong> 4963</li>
<li>the United States and other Western nations have little credibility in the Middle East given their long support for sultanistic dictators. Any efforts to use aid to back certain groups or influence electoral outcomes are likely to arouse suspicion. <strong>loc</strong> 4966</li>
<li>The greatest risk that Tunisia and Egypt now face is an attempt at counterrevolution by military conservatives, a group that has often sought to claim power after a sultan has been removed. <strong>loc</strong> 4970</li>
<li>main threat to democracies in the Middle East is war. Historically, revolutionary regimes have hardened and become more radical in response to international conflict. <strong>loc</strong> 4982</li>
<li>the one event that may cause radicals to hijack the Middle Eastern revolutions is if Israeli anxiety or Palestinian provocations escalate hostility between Egypt and Israel, leading to renewed war. <strong>loc</strong> 4985</li>

<li><p>The Heirs of Nasser Who Will Benefit From the Second Arab Revolution? Michael Scott Doran FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 4990</p>

<ul>
<li>Much like the ouster of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali from Tunisia in January, the Suez crisis generated a revolutionary spark. Nasser’s victory demonstrated that imperialism was a spent force and, by extension, that the Arab regimes created by the imperialists were living on borrowed time. <strong>loc</strong> 5004</li>
<li>Regimes fell and rose, countries united and fragmented, and armed conflicts erupted. Today’s turmoil, then, is not unique; rather, it represents the second Arab revolution. <strong>loc</strong> 5019 Note: 2nd arab revolution</li>
<li>Although the pan-Arab fervor of Nasser’s time and the political unrest of today are similar, there are at least two obvious differences. First, the dominant ideology of Nasser’s revolution, pan-Arabism, focused on external threats: gaining independence from imperialism and confronting Israel. In contrast, today’s revolutionary wave is driven by domestic demands: for jobs and political representation. Second, the political upheaval of the 1950s had a leader, Nasser, who guided—or appeared to guide—events, whereas today’s unrest has so far been an exercise in synchronized anarchy. <strong>loc</strong> 5022 Note: synchronized anarchy</li>
<li>Then, as now, the people in the street believed that the existing order was dominated by corrupt cliques that exploited the power of the state to serve their own interests. <strong>loc</strong> 5027</li>
<li>Nasser quickly learned that tearing down regimes was one thing, but building a new order was another altogether. His pan-Arab movement dissolved once it had achieved its immediate aim of ousting the imperialists. <strong>loc</strong> 5031 Note: important consideration</li>
<li>The balance of power between state and society is shifting. As popular participation in politics expands—and as the power of the police state recedes—two interconnected dynamics will accelerate: one, the number of politically significant actors within each state will increase; two, some of these actors will establish relationships across international boundaries. <strong>loc</strong> 5038</li>
<li>the porousness of Arab politics will give states greater opportunities to meddle in the affairs of their neighbors. <strong>loc</strong> 5042</li>
<li>the Obama administration should remember that it is not the only actor attempting to shape the turmoil. <strong>loc</strong> 5052</li>
<li>As the revolutionary wave expands political participation, the resistance bloc will insinuate itself into the politics of many different Arab states. In countries divided along ethnic, tribal, or sectarian lines, such as Iraq, it will use terrorism and will search for partners on the ground that are willing to make direct alliances. In more homogeneous and stable countries, such as Egypt, it will resort to more subtle and insidious means—for example, inciting violence against Israel. <strong>loc</strong> 5077 Note: role of iran</li>
<li>To understand the role of the Israeli question in Iran’s asymmetric regional contest with the United States, it is useful to borrow a word from Arabic: tawreet, which translates as “embroiling.” You embroil someone by goading him to take actions against a third party that will result in political effects beneficial to you. <strong>loc</strong> 5085</li>
<li>In those days, it was the United Kingdom that guaranteed the security of Arab countries. Today, it is the United States— and the conditions are once again ripe for tawreet, especially in Egypt. <strong>loc</strong> 5097</li>
<li>Tehran and Damascus view post-Mubarak Egypt as a chunk of the United States’ security architecture that has broken loose from key moorings. With a little effort, they believe, it can now be severed entirely. Arab-Israeli violence would help—either by undermining the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, by complicating U.S.-Egyptian cooperation, or simply by increasing the power of the Muslim Brotherhood and like-minded groups in Egypt. <strong>loc</strong> 5116 Note: does this hold true?</li>
<li>But in other countries, such as Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia, Iran has little or no influence over events, which are clearly spinning on their own independent axis. <strong>loc</strong> 5172</li>
<li>The most important arena in the months and years ahead, therefore, is the struggle for regional hegemony. <strong>loc</strong> 5184</li>
<li>The second Arab revolution may not have a charismatic leader, like Nasser, but it does have a representative figure who expresses the core aspirations of the revolutionaries: Mohamed Bouazizi, the 26-yearold Tunisian fruit vendor who set himself on fire out of despair and frustration with the state’s corruption and caprice. The widespread influence of Bouazizi’s desperate cry for justice and dignity should stand as a sharp reminder for Washington: for all that the struggle with the resistance bloc is about power politics, the emphasis must be on politics as much as on power. However vital the struggle for regional hegemony is to Washington, it is certainly not the central concern to the people who are protesting in the streets. <strong>loc</strong> 5188 Note: very important concept</li>

<li><p>The Rise of the Islamists How Islamists Will Change Politics, and Vice Versa Shadi Hamid FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 5199</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no question that democracy will make the region more unpredictable and some governments there less amenable to U.S. security interests. At their core, however, mainstream Islamist organizations, such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Jordan and al Nahda in Tunisia, have strong pragmatic tendencies. <strong>loc</strong> 5213</li>
<li>In the past few years, instead of calling for an “Islamic state,” for example, the Muslim Brotherhood began calling for a “civil, democratic state with an Islamic reference,” suggesting a newfound commitment to the separation of mosque and state (although not of religion and politics). This move seems to have been deliberately aimed, at least in part, at alleviating international fears; with the goal of improving its image, moreover, the group launched an internal initiative in 2005 called Reintroducing the Brotherhood to the West. <strong>loc</strong> 5230</li>
<li>mainstream Islamists have rhetorically retained much of the Muslim Brotherhood’s original Arab nationalism and anti-Israel politics. Today’s Egyptian and Libyan Muslim Brotherhoods and Tunisia’s al Nahda refuse to recognize Israel’s right to exist and call for the liberation of all of historic Palestine. They also view Hamas not as a terrorist group but as a legitimate force of resistance. <strong>loc</strong> 5235</li>
<li>As political systems across the Middle East open up, Islamist groups such as the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and al Nahda will likely try to move from the opposition into coalition or unity governments. <strong>loc</strong> 5259</li>
<li>Democratic governments reflect popular sentiment, and in the Middle East, this sentiment is firmly against Israel and U.S. hegemony in the region. <strong>loc</strong> 5298</li>
<li>For their part, the Western media have tended to idealize the revolutions sweeping the Middle East. Tahrir Square was portrayed as a postideological utopia and Egyptians as pro-American liberals in the making. True, Egyptians (and Tunisians and Libyans) have wanted democracy for decades and showed during their revolution a knack for protest, peaceful expression, and self-governance. But for all the changes of the past months, the United States remains a status quo power in a region undergoing radical change. Arabs across the region have been protesting an authoritarian order that the United States was, in their view, central in propagating. At their core, the revolutions sweeping the Middle East are about dignity and self-determination. <strong>loc</strong> 5316</li>
<li>Hammam Said, the hard-line leader of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood put it more bluntly: “America must think seriously about changing its policy in the region, for people will no longer remain submissive to its dictates.” <strong>loc</strong> 5329</li>
<li>the revolutions have made the shortsightedness of current U.S. policy—studiously avoiding formal contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood and like-minded groups—clear. The West knows much less about Egypt’s most powerful opposition force than it should, and could. <strong>loc</strong> 5340</li>

<li><p>Terrorism After the Revolutions How Secular Uprisings Could Help (or Hurt) Jihadists Daniel Byman FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MAY/JUNE 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 5352</p>

<ul>
<li>On December 17, Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire to protest police harassment. His death incited unrest throughout Tunisia; less than a month later, protests toppled Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Egypt, the most populous and influential country in the Arab world, soon followed suit. Al Qaeda met both these dramatic events with near silence. <strong>loc</strong> 5359</li>
<li>Although bin Laden and al Qaeda have been attempting to overthrow Arab governments for more than 20 years, the toppling of the seemingly solid dictatorships in Tunisia and Egypt caught them flat-footed and undermined their message of violent jihad. <strong>loc</strong> 5369</li>
<li>When dictators reigned supreme in Arab lands, al Qaeda could score points by denouncing despotism—Zawahiri even wrote a book condemning the crimes of Mubarak. When dictators such as Mubarak fall due to pressure from pro-democracy protesters, however, al Qaeda loses one of its best recruiting pitches: the repression Arab governments inflict on their citizens. The rise of less repressive leaders would deprive al Qaeda propagandists of this valuable argument. <strong>loc</strong> 5376</li>
<li>Although the word “democracy” means different things to different audiences, polls suggest that the generic concept is quite popular in the Arab world, as befits a region that knows firsthand how brutal autocracy can be. <strong>loc</strong> 5383</li>
<li>if Tunisia’s emerging democratic movement does not soon hand power over to clerics that implement an Islamic state, then—according to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)—“the duty upon Muslims in Tunisia is to be ready and not lay down their weapons.” Al Qaeda’s message is clear: secular democracy is as abhorrent as secular dictatorship. <strong>loc</strong> 5388</li>
<li>Youths in Tunisia and Egypt did not heed his call; the protesters were peaceful and largely secular in their demands. As U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said of al Qaeda’s leaders, “I hope they were watching on television as Egyptian young people proved them wrong.” A number of prominent jihadist scholars, such as Abu Basir al-Tartusi and Hamid al-Ali, echoed her, praising the protesters’ courage and endorsing the revolutions despite their largely secular demands. <strong>loc</strong> 5393</li>
<li>For over a decade, al Qaeda has portrayed its young fighters as the most audacious and honorable defenders of Muslim lands in the face of Western aggression. Now, youths in the Arab world are afire with very different ideas—of freedom and nonviolent action. <strong>loc</strong> 5401</li>
<li>Indeed, one measure of how much progress the Arab regimes are making toward democracy will be how much their security services are purged. The same security services that have fought al Qaeda and its affiliates have also imprisoned peaceful bloggers, beaten up Islamist organizers to intimidate them, and censored pro-democracy newspapers. <strong>loc</strong> 5417</li>
<li>Despite the challenge that the secular revolutions have posed to al Qaeda’s narrative, there is a chance that the organization could rebound and become even stronger operationally. <strong>loc</strong> 5428 Note: isil?</li>
<li>Jihadists are media savvy and will try to exploit any new freedoms to expand their propaganda efforts. <strong>loc</strong> 5445 Note: again, isil?</li>
<li>Islamist organizations in general are highly critical of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, skeptical of cooperation with the CIA, and strongly opposed to anything that smacks of normal relations with Israel. Supporting a strong Islamist role in government risks creating a regime less friendly to the United States; excluding the Islamists risks radicalizing the movement and reinvigorating al Qaeda. <strong>loc</strong> 5468</li>
<li>Opportunities for al Qaeda will also arise if unrest turns to civil war, as has happened in Libya. In Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iraq, Somalia, and Yemen, civil wars began largely for local reasons, with little jihadist involvement. Over time, however, al Qaeda and like-minded groups moved in. First, they posed as supporters of the opposition. Then, they spread their vitriol, using their superior resources to attract new recruits, while the surrounding violence helped radicalize the opposition. Al Qaeda now has a strong presence in all these countries. Already, AQIM—the regional al Qaeda affiliates geographically closest to Libya—is issuing statements in support of the anti-Qaddafi fighters. <strong>loc</strong> 5472</li>
<li>In Libya, it is possible that the United States and local jihadist fighters will end up fighting the same enemy. This happened in the Balkans in the 1990s, when Washington was helping the Bosnian Muslims just as Arab jihadists were seeking to assist the Muslims against the Serbs and turn Bosnia into a new Afghanistan. <strong>loc</strong> 5477</li>
<li>U.S. public diplomacy efforts should relentlessly highlight al Qaeda’s criticisms of democracy and emphasize the now credible idea that reform can come through peaceful change. The message should be spread by television and radio, as always, but particular attention should be paid to the Internet, given the importance of reaching young people. <strong>loc</strong> 5482 Note: media propoganda</li>

<li>More recently, tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many Muslims, and a Cold War in which Muslim-majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations. Moreover, the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many Muslims to view the West as hostile to the traditions of Islam. <strong>loc</strong> 5524</li>
<li>So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. <strong>loc</strong> 5530</li>
<li>We were born out of revolution against an empire. We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words—within our borders, and around the world. We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribus unum—“Out of many, one.” <strong>loc</strong> 5563</li>
<li>For we have learned from recent experience that when a financial system weakens in one country, prosperity is hurt everywhere. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations. When violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean. When innocents in Bosnia and Darfur are slaughtered, that is a stain on our collective conscience. That is what it means to share this world in the twenty-first century. That is the responsibility we have to one another as human beings. <strong>loc</strong> 5578 Note: our shared responsibility</li>
<li>we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said: “I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be.” <strong>loc</strong> 5617</li>
<li>violence is a dead end. <strong>loc</strong> 5655</li>
<li>But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn’t steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. These are not just American ideas; they are human rights. And that is why we will support them everywhere. <strong>loc</strong> 5700</li>

<ul>
<li>Bashir al-Saadawi said, “Freedom is a tree in whose shade no one can sit except the one who planted it with his hands and watered it with his blood.” Libya is a tree in whose shade we sit, for it is we who planted it with our hands and watered it with our blood. <strong>loc</strong> 6030</li>
<li>But Muammar Qaddafi is history, resistance, liberation, glory, and revolution.

<li>Your children have died. But their children did not die. They are in America, and in Europe. What is this fear of these gangs? Gangs, like rats, they represent nothing. They do not represent one out of a million of the Libyan people. They are worth nothing. They are a handful of young men, imitating what was happening in Egypt and Tunisia, and who were given pills, and were given orders to burn and loot. Mimicry! Rats! <strong>loc</strong> 6068</li>
<li>Anyone who employs force, or any other means not allowed by law and the constitution, in order to change the constitution and the system of governance, is punishable by death. They are changing the rule of the people. Their punishment is death according to the law. <strong>loc</strong> 6095</li>
<li>When the order is given to use force, we will be ready. Then everything will be burned. <strong>loc</strong> 6100</li>
<li>if this not fulfilled, and if Libya’s unity is endangered… if we see this happening, we will prevent it. Then we will declare the march.… We will declare the holy march. Oh yes.… We will issue a call to the millions, from the desert to the desert. And I and the millions will march in order to cleanse Libya, inch by inch, house by house, home by home, alley by alley, individual by individual, so that the country is purified from the unclean. We cannot allow for Libya to be lost from our hands without justification.… I have millions on my side. I have God on my side, who has made me victorious over the great powers. <strong>loc</strong> 6109</li>

<li><p>Excerpts from the Sermon of Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi TAHRIR SQUARE, CAIRO, EGYPT, FEBRUARY 23, 2011 <strong>loc</strong> 6113</p>

<li>This is Egypt when it believes. This is why these youth from all regions in Egypt, from all social classes, rich and poor, educated and illiterate, workers and cultured—though the majority were cultured and educated people—we saw altruism increase among them. They became, they fused into, one melting pot: Muslims and Christians, radicals and conservatives, rightists and leftists, men and women, old and young, all of them became one, all of them acting for Egypt, in order to liberate Egypt from injustice (zulm) and tyranny (tâghût). It was inevitable that Egypt be liberated, because these youth willed it, and when the youth will, their will participates of the will of God. <strong>loc</strong> 6127</li>
<li>We want a new government, in which there are none of these faces that people cannot bear anymore. Every time people see them, they remember the injustice, they remember the killing, they remember the falseness, they remember the raid of the camels, the mules, and the horses, they remember the snipers who kill people, they remember the vehicle that is going right and left, back and forth, and is killing people, running people over! <strong>loc</strong> 6174</li>
<li>I will say some words to the regimes ruling in the Arab countries. I will say to them: “Don’t be arrogant! Don’t delude yourselves! Don’t stop history! Nobody will be able to fight the divine decrees, nor to delay the day when it rises. This world has changed and the world has evolved. The Arab world has changed from the inside. So, do not stand against the peoples (sha’b). Try to come to an understanding with them! Don’t deceive them! Don’t try to get them with empty words! It is not possible that peoples (sha’b) remain silent. Dialogue with them in a real dialogue, not to patch things up, but with constructive actions, constructive actions that put things in their places, respect the minds of people (nâs) and respect the minds of the peoples (sha’b)!” This is my message to the rulers of the Arabs. <strong>loc</strong> 6199</li>

<li><p>What Is the Revolution? What Is the Regime? FROM REVOLUTIONARY EGYPT, VOLUME 2 <strong>loc</strong> 6214</p>

<ul>
<li>If we now were to take a look at the situation in Egypt, we would see the regime as it really is. Despite the fact that it sacrificed some of its figureheads, here it is trying to use all of its forces, ferociously, to protect its interests. These victories that we have realized are nothing but concessions that it was forced to make under the pressure of the masses. <strong>loc</strong> 6226</li>
<li>In reality, the revolution does not happen simply because the majority changed their minds overnight. Rather, these thoughts changed on the level of the masses by way of their struggle. The thoughts changed during the struggle when the masses realized their ability to enact change. They also realized that the toiling classes, ground to bits, had a shared interest in facing off against their leaders. They also realized that the differences the ruling class tried to use to split them do not have any importance. There is no difference between women and men or Muslims and Christians. <strong>loc</strong> 6237</li>
<li>The revolution is not an event that happens on a specific day but is a process of change. If we want now to continue our revolution in order to realize the goals we have not yet achieved, then we have to organize ourselves to face off against the organized enemies of the revolution, the old regime. Our martyrs who gave their lives during the revolution did not do so in order that another ruler could take Mubarak’s place nor to paint the sidewalks. They gave their lives for real change in society—a society with real freedom, free of any kind of repression and oppression, in which wealth is redistributed in order to realize social justice. <strong>loc</strong> 6245 Note: nice statement</li>
