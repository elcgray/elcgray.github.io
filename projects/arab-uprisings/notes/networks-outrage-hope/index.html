  <h1 class="page-title">Notes | Networks of Outrage and Hope</h1>
  <ul>
<li>trust is what glues together society, the market, the institutions. Without trust, nothing works. Without trust, the social contract dissolves and people disappear as they transform into defensive individuals fighting for survival. loc 148</li>
<li>it was primarily the humiliation provoked by the cynicism and arrogance of those in power, be it financial, political or cultural, that brought together those who turned fear into outrage, and outrage into hope for a better humanity. loc 165</li>
<li>On October 15, 2011, a global network of occupying movements under the banner of “United for Global Change” mobilized hundreds of thousands in 951 cities in 82 countries around the world, claiming social justice and true democracy. In all cases the movements ignored political parties, distrusted the media, did not recognize any leadership and rejected all formal organization, relying on the Internet and local assemblies for collective debate and decision-making. loc 179 <strong>Note</strong>: are these the criteria to watch for? - lack of political affiliation - distrust of mass media - rejection of formal organization and leadership - reliance upon Internet and local assemblies - structure based on collective debate and decision-making</li>
<li>power relationships are constitutive of society because those who have power construct the institutions of society according to their values and interests. loc 193 <strong>Note</strong>: agreed</li>
<li>Power is exercised by means of coercion (the monopoly of violence, legitimate or not, by the control of the state) and/or by the construction of meaning in people’s minds, through mechanisms of symbolic manipulation. loc 194 <strong>Note</strong>: valuable consideration</li>
<li>Power relations are embedded in the institutions of society, and particularly in the state. loc 195 <strong>Note</strong>: what happens when states shift or break down?</li>
<li>The actual configuration of the state and other institutions that regulate people’s lives depends on this constant interaction between power and counterpower. loc 199</li>
<li>Torturing bodies is less effective than shaping minds. loc 204</li>
<li>the fundamental power struggle is the battle for the construction of meaning in the minds of the people. loc 206</li>
<li>The ongoing transformation of communication technology in the digital age extends the reach of communication media to all domains of social life in a network that is at the same time global and local, generic and customized in an ever-changing pattern. loc 210</li>
<li>Although each individual human mind constructs its own meaning by interpreting the communicated materials on its own terms, this mental processing is conditioned by the communication environment. loc 214</li>
<li>Mass self-communication is based on horizontal networks of interactive communication that, by and large, are difficult to control by governments or corporations. loc 221</li>
<li>digital communication is multimodal and allows constant reference to a global hypertext of information whose components can be remixed by the communicative actor according to specific projects of communication. loc 222</li>
<li>Mass self-communication provides the technological platform for the construction of the autonomy of the social actor, be it individual or collective, vis-à-vis the institutions of society. This is why governments are afraid of the Internet, and this is why corporations have a love-hate relationship with it and are trying to extract profits while limiting its potential for freedom (for instance, by controlling file sharing or open source networks). loc 223</li>
<li>Networks of power exercise their power by influencing the human mind predominantly (but not solely) through multimedia networks of mass communication. Thus, communication networks are decisive sources of power-making. loc 229</li>
<li>Global financial networks and global multimedia networks are intimately linked, and this particular meta-network holds extraordinary power. loc 231</li>
<li>These networks do not merge. Instead, they engage in strategies of partnership and competition by forming ad hoc networks around specific projects. But they all share a common interest: to control the capacity of defining the rules and norms of society through a political system that primarily responds to their interests and values. loc 235</li>
<li>it is via the state that different forms of exercising power in distinct social spheres relate to the monopoly of violence as the capacity to enforce power in the last resort. loc 240</li>
<li>If power is exercised by programming and switching networks, then counterpower, the deliberate attempt to change power relationships, is enacted by reprogramming networks around alternative interests and values, and/or disrupting the dominant switches while switching networks of resistance and social change. loc 250 <strong>Note</strong>: is this cstell&#39;s manifesto?</li>
<li>Digital social networks offer the possibility for largely unfettered deliberation and coordination of action. However, this is only one component of the communicative processes through which social movements relate to society at large. loc 262</li>
<li>Occupied spaces have played a major role in the history of social change, as well as in contemporary practice, for three basic reasons: 1. They create community, and community is based on togetherness. loc 266</li>
<li>Occupied spaces are not meaningless: they are usually charged with the symbolic power of invading sites of state power, or financial institutions. loc 275</li>
<li>The control of space symbolizes the control over people’s lives. loc 280 <strong>Note</strong>: gezi park?</li>
<li>By constructing a free community in a symbolic place, social movements create a public space, a space for deliberation, which ultimately becomes a political space, a space for sovereign assemblies to meet and to recover their rights of representation, which have been captured in political institutions predominantly tailored for the convenience of the dominant interests and values. loc 282</li>
<li>The autonomy of communication is the essence of social movements because it is what allows the movement to be formed, and what enables the movement to relate to society at large beyond the control of the power holders over communication power. loc 288</li>
<li>social movements always have an array of structural causes and individual reasons to rise up against one or many of the dimensions of social domination. loc 296</li>
<li>the actual practices that allow social movements to rise and change institutions and, ultimately, social structure, are enacted by individuals: persons in their material flesh and minds. loc 305</li>
<li>the key question to understand is when and how and why one person or one thousand persons decide, individually, to do something that they are repeatedly warned not to do because they will be punished. loc 306 <strong>Note</strong>: good question</li>
<li>At the individual level, social movements are emotional movements. Insurgency does not start with a program or political strategy. This may come later, as leadership emerges, from inside or from outside the movement, to foster political, ideological and personal agendas that may or may not relate to the origins and motivations of participants in the movement. But the big bang of a social movement starts with the transformation of emotion into action. loc 313 <strong>Note</strong>: where revolution starts</li>
<li>hope is a fundamental ingredient in supporting goal-seeking action. loc 322</li>
<li>The faster and more interactive the process of communication is, the more likely the formation of a process of collective action becomes, rooted in outrage, propelled by enthusiasm and motivated by hope. loc 336 <strong>Note</strong>: enter: social media</li>
<li>The characteristics of communication processes between individuals engaged in the social movement determine the organizational characteristics of the social movement itself: the more interactive and self-configurable communication is, the less hierarchical is the organization and the more participatory is the movement. This is why the networked social movements of the digital age represent a new species of social movement. loc 340 <strong>Note</strong>: old vs. new</li>
<li>The misrepresentation of the movements by their leaders, ideologues or chroniclers does have considerable consequences, as it introduces an irreversible cleavage between the actors of the movement and the projects constructed on their behalf, often without their knowledge and consent. loc 357</li>
<li>for the networks of counterpower to prevail over the networks of power embedded in the organization of society, they will have to reprogram the polity, the economy, the culture or whatever dimension they aim to change by introducing in the institutions’ programs, as well as in their own lives, other instructions, including, in some utopian versions, the rule of not ruling anything. loc 363</li>
<li>“A Network Theory of Power,” International Journal of Communication 5, 773–87. loc 386</li>
<li>In the first mass demonstration in Cairo’s Tahrir Square on January 25, 2011, thousands shouted “Tunisia is the solution,” purposely modifying the slogan “Islam is the solution” that had dominated social mobilizations in the Arab world in recent years. loc 400</li>
<li>when New Yorkers occupied public spaces around Wall Street on September 17, 2011, they named their first encampment Tahrir Square, loc 405</li>
<li>What could be the common thread that united in people’s minds their experiences of revolt in spite of the vastly diverse cultural, economic and institutional contexts? In a nutshell: their feeling of empowerment. It was born from their disgust with their governments and the political class, be it dictatorial or, in their view, pseudo-democratic. It was prompted by their outrage towards the perceived complicity between the financial elite and the political elite. It was triggered by the emotional upheaval that resulted from some unbearable event. And it was made possible by overcoming fear through togetherness built in the networks of cyberspace and in the communities of urban space. loc 406</li>
<li>New avenues of political change, through autonomous capacity to communicate and organize, have been discovered by a young generation of activists, beyond the reach of the usual methods of corporate and political control. And, while there were already a number of precedents of such new social movements in the last decade (particularly in Spain in 2004 and in Iran in 2009), we may say that in its full-fledged manifestation it all started in Tunisia and in Iceland. loc 415</li>
<li>The name of Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old street vendor, has now been engraved in history as the one who changed the destiny of the Arab world. loc 421</li>
<li>only a few hours after he set himself on fire, hundreds of youth, sharing similar experiences of humiliation by the authorities, staged a protest in front of the same building. loc 426</li>
<li>There were other symbolic suicides and attempted suicides that fed the anger and stimulated the courage of youth. loc 427</li>
<li>on January 12, 2011, General Rachid Ammar, the Chief of Staff of the Tunisian Armed Forces, refused to open fire on the protesters. He was immediately dismissed, but on January 14, 2011, the dictator Ben Ali and his family left Tunisia to find refuge in Saudi Arabia when confronted with the withdrawal of support from the French Government, Ben Ali’s closest ally since his coming to power in 1987. loc 430</li>
<li>They kept shouting “Degage! Degage! (Get out of here!)” vis-à-vis all powers that be: corrupt politicians, financial speculators, brutal police and subservient media. loc 435</li>
<li>The connection between free communication on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and the occupation of urban space created a hybrid public space of freedom that became a major feature of the Tunisian rebellion, foreshadowing the movements to come in other countries. loc 438 <strong>Note</strong>: role of social media</li>
<li>On January 22, 2011, the Convoy of Liberty (Qâfilat al-hurriyya), beginning in Sidi Bouzid and Menzel Bouzaiane, reached the Kasbah in the Tunis Medina, calling for the resignation of the provisional government of Mohamed Ghannouchi, an obvious continuation of the regime in personnel and policies. loc 441</li>
<li>They filmed themselves and diffused the video of the debates on the Internet. But their language was not only digital. The walls of the square were covered with slogans in Arabic, French and English, since the movement wanted to relate to the outside world to claim their rights and aspirations. loc 445</li>
<li>“If the people one day wish to live, destiny will have to respond” (Idhâ I-sha ‘bu yawman arâda I-hayât, fa-lâ budda an yastadjiba al-qadar). loc 448</li>
<li>Although there were no leaders, some informal organization emerged to take care of the logistics and to enforce rules of engagement in the debates in the square: loc 449</li>
<li>They were outraged by the control of both politics and the economy by the clan of the Trabelsi, the family of the second wife of Ben Ali, whose crooked deals had been exposed in the diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks. loc 457</li>
<li>this was not an Islamic movement, in spite of the presence of a strong Islamist current among the protesters, for the simple reason that there is widespread influence of political Islamism in the Tunisian society. loc 459</li>
<li>this was a national Tunisian movement that used the national flag and sang the national anthem as a rallying cry, claiming the legitimacy of the nation against the appropriation of the nation by an illegitimate political regime backed by the former colonial powers, particularly France and the United States. loc 461</li>
<li>The search for dignity in response to institutionally-backed humiliation was an essential emotional driver of the protests. loc 466</li>
<li>This mixture of education and lack of opportunities was a breeding ground for revolt in Tunisia, as in all other Arab countries. loc 470</li>
<li>A post on Facebook expressed clearly a certain state of mind: “Most politicians have white hair and a black heart. We want people who have black hair and a white heart.” loc 477</li>
<li>Intense working class struggles had taken place in Ben Guerdane (2009) and in the phosphate mines of Gafsa (2010), but they were violently repressed with scores of people killed, injured and arrested, and ultimately contained. Dissidents were tortured and jailed. Street demonstrations were rare. We know that the spark of the revolt came from the sacrifice of Mohamed Bouazizi. But how did the spark set fire to the prairie and how and why did it spread? loc 482</li>
<li>New, distinctive factors made possible the success of the Tunisian popular revolts in 2011 over a sustained period of time. Among these factors appears prominently the role played by the Internet and Al Jazeera in triggering, amplifying and coordinating spontaneous revolts as an expression of outrage, particularly among the youth. loc 485</li>
<li>It was in the connection between social networks on the Internet and social networks in people’s lives where the protest was forged. Thus, the precondition for the revolts was the existence of an Internet culture, made up of bloggers, social networks and cyberactivism. loc 493</li>
<li>These growing free voices that spread on the Internet in spite of censorship and repression found a powerful ally in satellite television beyond government control, particularly Al Jazeera. loc 497</li>
<li>This Al Jazeera–Internet link was essential during the weeks of the revolts, both in Tunisia and in relation to the Arab world. Al Jazeera went so far as to develop a communication program to allow mobile phones to connect directly to its satellite without requiring sophisticated equipment. Twitter also played a major role in discussing the events and coordinating actions. Demonstrators used the hashtag #sidibouzid on Twitter to debate and communicate, thus indexing the Tunisian revolution. loc 500</li>
<li>it is significant to point out that Tunisia has one of the highest rates of Internet and mobile phone penetration in the Arab world. loc 507</li>
<li>Since there is a direct connection between young age, higher education and the use of the Internet, the unemployed college graduates who were the key actors in the revolution were also frequent Internet users, and some were sophisticated users who utilized the communicative potential of the Internet to build and expand their movement. loc 511</li>
<li>we find a significant convergence of three distinctive features: 1. The existence of an active group of unemployed college graduates, who led the revolt, bypassing any formal, traditional leadership; 2. The presence of a strong cyberactivism culture that had engaged in the open critique of the regime for over one decade; 3. A relatively high rate of diffusion of Internet use, including household connections, schools and cybercafés. loc 517 <strong>Note</strong>: good high-level overview</li>
<li>With the support of a newly independent media, particularly in the case of the print press, the democratic movement opened a new political space and reached the milestone of clean, open elections on October 23, 2011. loc 527</li>
<li>veteran Islamist political intellectual Rached Gannouchi, became prime minister. loc 529</li>
<li>He does not represent a return to tradition or to the imposition of Sharia. loc 531</li>
<li>His most explicit contemporary reference is the Freedom and Development Party led by Erdogan in Turkey, but this has been consistent with his own position over the years. loc 535</li>
<li>The president, Moncef Marzuki, is a secular personality, and the draft of the new Constitution is no more reliant on God’s will than is the Constitution of the United States. loc 536</li>
<li>Indeed, the acceptance of a modern Islamist party at the forefront of the political system has marginalized, without excluding, the radical Islamic forces. However, this may change if the new democratic governments are not able to tackle the dramatic issues of mass unemployment, extreme poverty, widespread corruption and bureaucratic arrogance that have not been dissolved by the atmosphere of freedom. loc 538</li>
<li>they were also pushing for a re-foundation of the republic, which had become corrupted, in their view, by the subordination of politicians and political parties to the financial elite. And so, they asked for the drafting of a new Constitution, loc 597 <strong>Note</strong>: iceland</li>
<li>May 30, 2011, Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir stated, in the clearest possible terms, that: The overpaid crowd, the “banksters,” and the big property elites will not be allowed to gobble up the coming economic growth … Their debauched party was held under the Independence party’s neoconservative fanfare. The quality of life Icelanders have in the future, will, on the other hand, be built on equality. loc 617</li>
<li>The Althing (its representative assembly still in place nowadays under a different form) was established before the year 1000. And yet, after experiencing the cronyism and aloofness of the political class, Iceland plunged into the same crisis of legitimacy as most countries in the world. loc 645</li>
<li>the final constitutional bill was literally produced through crowdsourcing. Some observers have labeled it a wiki-constitution (www.wired.co.uk./news/archive/2011-08/01/iceland-constitution loc 660</li>
<li>Icelanders insurged, as did people in all other countries, against a brand of speculative financial capitalism that destroyed people’s livelihood. But their outrage came from the realization that the democratic institutions did not represent the interests of citizens because the political class had become a self-reproducing cast that was catering to the interests of the financial elite, and to the preservation of their monopoly over the state. loc 697</li>
<li>The key differentiating factor between Iceland and the rest of Europe is that the Icelandic government made the bankers pay for the costs of the crisis, while relieving people from its hardship as much as possible. This is in fact one of the key demands from protesters throughout Europe. loc 704</li>
<li>in some posts on the Internet reflecting on Iceland’s constitutional experience, there is reference to the Corsican Constitution of 1755 that is considered to be one of the sources of inspiration for the Constitution of the United States (www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/10 loc 710</li>
<li>Both revolts insurged against the consequences of a dramatic economic crisis, although in Tunisia this was not as much due to a financial collapse as to the plundering of the country’s economy by a clique rooted in the predatory state. Moreover, people felt powerless because of the obvious intertwining of the business oligarchs and the political class, be it democratically elected or dictatorially imposed. loc 726</li>
<li>The democratic deficit, although in vastly different proportions, was present in both countries, and it was a major source of discontent at the roots of the protests. loc 731</li>
<li>Tunisia, it is the most ethnically homogeneous country of the Arab world, and Sunni Muslims represent the overwhelming proportion of the population. loc 735</li>
<li>On the Tunisian revolution loc 762 <strong>Note</strong>: look at these</li>
<li>The 25 January Revolution (Thawrat 25 Yanayir), which in 18 days dethroned the last Pharaoh, arose from the depth of oppression, injustice, poverty, unemployment, sexism, mockery of democracy, and police brutality. loc 859</li>
<li>6 April Youth Movement,2 which created a Facebook group attracting 70,000 followers. loc 865</li>
<li>Most prominent among these initiatives was the network created around the Facebook group “We are all Khaled Said,” named in the memory of the young activist beaten to death by the police in June 2010 in an Alexandria cybercafé after he distributed a video exposing police corruption. loc 868</li>
<li>These groups, and others, called for supporters on Facebook to demonstrate in front of the Ministry of Interior to protest against the police brutality that had terrorized Egyptians for three decades. They chose January 25 because it was National Police Day. loc 872</li>
<li>However, the actual spark that ignited the Egyptian revolution, prompting protests on an unprecedented scale, was inspired by the Tunisian revolution, which added the hope of change to the outrage against unbearable brutality. loc 874</li>
<li>The Egyptian revolution was dramatized, in the wake of the Tunisian example, by a series of self-immolations (six in total) to protest the rise of food prices that left many hungry. loc 875</li>
<li>one of the founders of the 6 April Youth Movement, Asmaa Mafhouz, a 26-year-old business student from the University of Cairo. On January 18 she posted a vlog on her Facebook page, showed her veiled face, and identified herself by name before stating: Four Egyptians set themselves on fire … People, have some shame! I, a girl, posted that I will go down to Tahrir Square to stand alone and I’ll hold the banner … I am making this video to give you a simple message: we are going to Tahrir on January 25th … If you stay home, you deserve all that’s being done to you, and you will be guilty before your nation and your people. Go down to the street, send SMSs, post it on the Net, make people aware. Someone uploaded the vlog to YouTube, and it was virally diffused by thousands. It came to be known throughout the Middle East as “The Vlog that Helped Spark the Revolution” (Wall and El Zahed 2011). loc 877</li>
<li>Particularly important were the fan networks of soccer teams, mainly al-Ahly as well as its rival Zamolek Sporting, who had a long history of battling the police. loc 886</li>
<li>Friday, January 28 came to be known as the Friday of Rage, loc 893</li>
<li>Fridays – this one and many others – have a special meaning in the Egyptian revolution as well as in other uprisings around the Arab world because it is the day of congregational prayer (also known as Jummah), and it is a holiday, and people congregate in the mosques, or outside the mosques. loc 896</li>
<li>Fridays became the weekly moment to rekindle the revolution. loc 900</li>
<li>There is no question that the original spaces of resistance were formed on the Internet, as traditional forms of protest were met with utmost ferocity by a police that had been torturing with impunity loc 909</li>
<li>the calls to demonstrate on January 25, and then on successive dates, were sent via Facebook, to be received by an active following made up of youth for whom social networks and mobile phones were a central part of their way of life. loc 911</li>
<li>In less than two years after Facebook launched its Arabic version in 2009, the number of users tripled, reaching 5 million users by February 2011, of which 600,000 were added in January and February, the months leading up to the start of the revolution. loc 916</li>
<li>social media networks played an important role in the Egyptian revolution. loc 919</li>
<li>Noha Atef, an activist interviewed during the revolution, points to the specific role of online-based mobilization: To have a space, an on-line space, to write and talk to people, to give them messages which will increase their anger, this is my favorite way of on-line activism … When you ask people to go and to demonstrate against the police, they were ready because you had already provided them with materials which made them angry (Aouragh and Alexander 2011: 1348). loc 925</li>
<li>Twitter provided the technological platform for multiple individuals to rise as trendsetters in the movement. loc 932</li>
<li>the activists, as some put it, planned the protests on Facebook, coordinated them through Twitter, spread them by SMSs and webcast them to the world on YouTube. loc 933</li>
<li>The viral nature of these videos and the volume and speed with which news on the events in Egypt became available to the wider public in the country and in the world was key to the process of mobilization against Mubarak. loc 936</li>
<li>This communal solidarity created in Tahrir Square became a role model for the Occupy movements that would spring up in the world in the following months. loc 945</li>
<li>As in all Arab uprisings, Al Jazeera played a major role in communicating in Arabic to the Egyptian population and to the Arab audiences at large that the unthinkable was actually happening. It contributed to a powerful demonstration effect that fed the unfolding of the uprisings in the Arab countries. While Western mainstream media lost interest in daily reporting on Egypt once Mubarak was removed from power, Al Jazeera continued to connect the Egyptian protesters to the Egyptian and Arab public opinion. loc 951</li>
<li>The connection between Internet’s social media, people’s social networks, and mainstream media was made possible because of the existence of an occupied territory that anchored the new public space in the dynamic interaction between cyberspace and urban space. loc 959</li>
<li>The Internet revolution does not negate the territorial character of revolutions throughout history. Instead, it extends it from the space of places to the space of flows. loc 966 <strong>Note</strong>: reach of revolutions today</li>
<li>Repression cannot be sustained against a massive movement supported by communication networks under global media attention unless the government is fully unified and can operate in cooperation with influential foreign powers. Because these conditions were not met in Egypt, the regime tried both violent repression and suppression of the Internet. So doing, it attempted to do what no regime had dared before: the great disconnection, switching off Internet access in the whole country as well as mobile phone networks. loc 970</li>
<li>On January 27, it blocked text messaging and BlackBerry messaging services. On the nights of January 27 and 28, the Egyptian government blocked Internet access almost entirely. There was not a central switch button to be activated. The government used a much older and more efficient technology. It placed successive telephone calls to the four biggest Internet service providers – Link Egypt, Vodafone/Raya, Telecom Egypt and Etisalat Misr – and ordered them to turn off the connections. loc 978</li>
<li>For two more days, Noor Data Networks, connecting Cairo’s stock exchange, was still functioning. When it went offline, 93 percent of the Internet traffic in or from Egypt was eliminated. loc 984</li>
<li>the most important obstacle governments face when trying to shut off the Internet comes from the vigilance of the global Internet community, which includes hackers, techies, companies, defenders of civil liberties, activist networks such as Anonymous and people from around the world for whom the Internet has become a fundamental right and a way of life. This community came to the rescue of Egypt as it did with Tunisia in 2010 and Iran in 2009. loc 989</li>
<li>When the government closed its satellite connection, other Arab satellite television networks offered Al Jazeera the use of their own frequencies. loc 995</li>
<li>other traditional communication channels like fax machines, ham radio and dial-up modems helped to overcome the blocking of the Internet. loc 996</li>
<li>The most important means of circumventing the blackout was the use of telephone landlines. They were not cut because countries nowadays cannot function without telephony of some kind. Using landlines, activists in Egypt reached telephone numbers abroad that would automatically forward the messages to computer networks provided by volunteers, such as those of TOR (The Onion Router network), which forwarded the messages back to Egypt by a variety of means. loc 1001</li>
<li>Engineers from Google and Twitter designed a speak-to-tweet program that automatically converted a voicemail message left into an answering machine accessed by a landline into a tweet. loc 1006</li>
<li>Since Twitter accounts in Egypt were blocked, Twitter created a new account – @twitterglobalpr – dedicated to the speak-to-tweet system in Egypt. loc 1008</li>
<li>Telecomix, developed a program that automatically retrieved messages by phone from Egypt and forwarded them to every fax machine in the country. loc 1009</li>
<li>old-fashioned technology became instrumental in overcoming government censorship. loc 1012</li>
<li>these different means added to the formation of a dense, multimodal network of communication that kept the movement connected within Egypt and with the world at large. loc 1013 <strong>Note</strong>: seems to be castells&#39; mantra</li>
<li>February 1, Internet access in Egypt was restored. Egyptian Internet service providers (ISPs) reconfigured their core routers, letting upstream providers and other networks reestablish data pathways. The speed with which the networks reconnected (in about half an hour, Internet in Egypt was up and running) shows that rather than physically plugging in cables, Egypt’s ISPs simply let other networks’ routers know about their availability using BGP or “border gateway protocol.” loc 1016</li>
<li>why did the government restore the Internet while the movement was still in full swing? The first reason was to contribute, under some pressure from the United States, to a “return to normal,” loc 1021</li>
<li>According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the five-day shutdown of Internet access in Egypt resulted in a loss of about US$90 million in revenue due to blocked telecommunications and Internet services, which account for around US$18 million per day; about 3 or 4 percent of Egypt’s annual GDP. loc 1024</li>
<li>the Internet is the lifeline of the interconnected global economy, and so its disconnection can only be exceptional and for a limited period of time. loc 1030 <strong>Note</strong>: dependency</li>
<li>the fundamental reason for the restoration of the Internet is that its shutdown was ineffective in stopping the movement. loc 1031</li>
<li>People were in the streets, media were reporting, and the whole world had become aware of a revolution in the making. loc 1034</li>
<li>Once a social movement has reached a certain threshold of size and impact, closing the Internet is neither possible nor effective. In the Internet Age, tyrants will have to reckon with people’s autonomous communication capacity. loc 1036</li>
<li>Bread, Freedom, and Social Justice were the main themes of the revolution, in the words of the demonstrators that took to the streets in January 2011. loc 1041</li>
<li>two-thirds of Egyptians are under the age of 30, and as the rate of unemployment among college graduates is 10 times higher than among the less-educated. loc 1044</li>
<li>while the movement was largely enacted by an impoverished middle class longing for freedom and human rights, segments of the urban poor, desperate as a result of rising food prices, joined in. loc 1047</li>
<li>The so-called pro-Mubarak masses, epitomized in the picturesque and ruthless charge of the camels on Tahrir occupiers on February 1, were in most cases connected to the balgatiya (gangs of thugs paid by the police) (Elmeshad and Sarant 2011). The real support for the regime was to be found among the hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats, Central security forces, policemen, informers, thugs and thieves, whose livelihood depended on the patronage networks of the dictator, his sons and their cronies. loc 1051</li>
<li>It was precisely the economic power struggle between the Army and Gamal’s boys (the businessmen protected by Mubarak’s son and heir apparent) that created the conditions for a decisive split within the ruling elites and prompted the downfall of Mubarak, his family and their clique. loc 1056 <strong>Note</strong>: good high-level overview</li>
<li>The whole of 2011 witnessed a relentless confrontation between the SCAF and the movement, while old and new political parties positioned themselves for the elections. loc 1067</li>
<li>Women were targeted, beaten and often killed during the demonstrations and assaults on Tahrir. loc 1107</li>
<li>On December 19, 2011, during a new assault on Tahrir, a young woman was beaten, stripped and left unconscious, wearing only a blue bra. Women who tried to help her were attacked by the police. The video of this barbaric act of sexist violence was diffused throughout the world and prompted universal outrage, particularly among women. It came to be known as the video of the “blue bra girl.” loc 1112</li>
<li>The awakening of Egyptian women during the revolution is one of the main fears of a deeply patriarchal society, and is triggering a wave of violence against women that may increase over time. loc 1118</li>
<li>It appears that there is a revolution within the revolution brewing in the Egyptian uprising, as a generation of educated women (who represent the majority of college graduates) confront the ancestral limits of men’s definition of what a revolution should be. loc 1128</li>
<li>The old Muslim Brotherhood survived decades of repression from nationalist, military regimes and, renamed as the Freedom and Justice Party, obtained a majority of seats in the Parliament. It benefitted from strong organization, political experience and a certain aura of resistance against the regime in large segments of the population. loc 1132</li>
<li>in practically all Arab countries, there is a potential Islamic political majority that was held in check by force from nationalist authoritarian leaders backed by the army and the Western powers. loc 1136</li>
<li>Arab nationalism, invoking the anti- colonial nation-state, in spite of rhetorical religious references when the need arose, and Islamism, invoking the ummah (universal community of believers beyond the nation) and the Sharia (law inspired by God, not by the state), have been locked in a confrontation that evolved towards the defeat of nationalism in people’s minds when it became subordinated to foreign powers and when corruption and brutality became the distinctive features of these regimes. loc 1137</li>
<li>The unconditional support of foreign powers for Arab military regimes was precisely predicated on their fear of Islamism as a threat to oil supply and Israel’s security. Thus, as expected, processes of democratization in the Arab world usually result in the hegemony of Islamism in the political system, as secular, progressive political forces have limited appeal beyond the small segments of Westernized elites. loc 1142</li>
<li>In sum, for the Muslim Brotherhood, Islam and democracy are fully compatible, as shown in the example of Turkey, albeit they concede that contexts are different, and they do not identify with Erdogan. loc 1157</li>
<li>A different matter is the significant groundswell of support for the Salafists, whose uncompromising stand on the primacy of Sharia over civilian power could evolve into a full-scale confrontation against both the army and the secular wing of the revolutionary movement. loc 1160</li>
<li>should be clear that neither in the origin nor in the process of transformation of the 2011 revolution was there any dominance of Islamism or Islamic themes. loc 1164</li>
<li>neither the Brotherhood nor the Salafists were successful in controlling or leading the movement. They were a part of the movement, but they were not the movement. loc 1170</li>
<li>The military even tried to impose a document (known as the Selmi document from the name of the Deputy Prime Minister) as a guideline for the Constitution to be elaborated in 2012 by the new Parliament, before the Parliament was elected. It basically gave full control of the state and limitless autonomy to the Armed Forces. loc 1178</li>
<li>On November 18, a massive protest against SCAF took place in Tahrir. On November 19, Central Security forces, the elite of former Mubarak’s police, attacked Tahrir Square, occupied only by a small group of people. loc 1182</li>
<li>The monopoly of violence is a necessary condition for holding power, but not a sufficient one in the long run. It requires the construction of legitimacy, or of acceptance and resignation, in people’s minds. loc 1203</li>
<li>Repression worked as long as it was concentrated on one particular segment of polity. But legitimacy was eroded by military failure and the fall of Nasser, and more importantly by the inability of a statist economy to adapt to the new environment of economic globalization. loc 1209</li>
<li>Widespread poverty and the deterioration of living standards for an increasingly educated middle class prompted many youth to turn to Islamism, both in its moderate and radical versions. loc 1212</li>
<li>Power is multidimensional. Each one of the dimensions (economic, political, military, ideological, cultural) is enacted by specific networks of power. loc 1216</li>
<li>privileged connection to the United States. This was a fundamental source of stability for the dictatorship both in terms of fake democratic credentials, and in its ability to withstand economic difficulties and domestic challenges. loc 1227</li>
<li>Outrage induces fearless risk-taking, and there was extreme outrage against police abuse, against hunger rising in the country and against the desperation that led people to immolate themselves. However, outrage had been there for quite a long time. The key difference was that another potent, positive emotion was present: Hope. Tunisia epitomized the hope for change. It showed that it was possible to topple a well-entrenched regime if everybody would come together and fight uncompromisingly, to the end, regardless of the risks. loc 1237</li>
<li>the geopolitical network, dominated by the United States, switched off its connection with Mubarak’s network to strengthen its privileged connection with the military network. Obama’s Cairo speech calling the Arab world to embrace and mobilize for democracy, and Hillary Clinton’s speech in January 2010 arguing for the democratizing role of the Internet in the world, could not be openly contradicted by continuing support for a shaken dictator. loc 1252</li>
<li>the military network, and its connected geopolitical network, tried to regain legitimacy by apparently moving towards democratic elections, legalizing Islamic political forces, promising a new constitution, and prosecuting the dictator and a few individuals of his immediate loc 1258</li>
<li>2011 was a much more bloody and repressive year than any of the preceding years under Mubarak. loc 1263</li>
<li>The significant role of al-Ahly soccer club fans in the protests against Mubarak was not forgotten by the central security police. loc 1282</li>
<li>In the wake of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, Days of Rage (Youm al-Ghadab) surged across the Arab world in 2011: loc 1457</li>
<li>February 17 in Libya, loc 1459</li>
<li>In Yemen, Libya and Syria, initially peaceful movements were met with utmost violence from the dictatorships, degenerating in civil wars that transformed these countries into battlefields where geopolitical contenders fought to assert their influence. loc 1464</li>
<li>foreign direct military intervention was decisive in Libya loc 1466</li>
<li>These various movements emerged from causes specific to each country, and evolved according to the conditions of their contexts and to the idiosyncrasies of each revolt. However, they were all spontaneous uprisings stimulated by the hope inspired by the success of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, conveyed by images and messages arriving from the Internet and from Arab satellite television networks. loc 1467 <strong>Note</strong>: power of hope</li>
<li>The interaction between the protests and the regimes depended on internal and geopolitical conditions. loc 1474</li>
<li>the majority of these countries’ populations were composed of people under 30 years of age, many of them relatively educated, and most of them unemployed or underemployed. These youth were familiar with the use of digital communication networks, loc 1478</li>
<li>The hope was provided by other Arab youth, like themselves, who had risen up in other countries, particularly in Egypt, known in the Arab cultural imagination as um al-dunya (“mother of the world”). loc 1483</li>
<li>Dignity and bread were the original drivers of most movements, loc 1491</li>
<li>asking for bread meant actually to reverse economic policies, and to end corruption as a way of governance. The assertion of dignity became a cry for democracy. Thus all movements became political movements, asking for democratic reforms. loc 1491</li>
<li>the interplay of internal factionalism and geopolitical influences led to bloody civil wars whose differential outcome is redefining the politics of the Arab world in the coming years. loc 1502</li>
<li>In Libya, the nation-state, while incarnating the messianic pan-Africanist project of its charismatic founder, expressed in reality the domination of Western tribes over Eastern tribes. loc 1518</li>
<li>Ruthless suppression of any attempt from the Bengazhi elites or from subdued tribes to claim their share of the bounty of oil and gas, mainly found in the Eastern desert, led to the concentration of power in Gaddafi’s family, their tribal supporters and a small circle of the elites in the Western areas of the country. loc 1519</li>
<li>there was not a real national army that could embody the institutions of the nation independently of the designs of the dictator and his clique. loc 1522</li>
<li>The Libyan state was largely a patrimonial state. loc 1523</li>
<li>The regime had a certain social base, supported by tribal divisions, fears and animosities that the leader played skillfully against one another for his own benefit. Most of the youth of Libya were disaffected politically vis-à-vis the regime, but in Tripoli they had greater economic opportunities than their counterparts in Egypt. loc 1525</li>
<li>the demonstrations that started on February 17 in Bengazhi, following calls in social media and through mobile phone networks, had only limited repercussions in Tripoli, and expressed both democratic aspirations and a regional and tribal rebellion against the authoritarian, patrimonial state. loc 1528</li>
<li>the rebellion quickly escalated to a civil war: by February 20, only three days after the beginning of the movement, the rebels had occupied Bengazhi and other towns in the East, and by February 23 they had taken Misrata, mid-way to Tripoli. loc 1531</li>
<li>Hours before Gaddaficould implement his announced intention to occupy Benghazi and search and kill all of the rebels house by house, 20 French bombers stopped the assault and internationalized the Libyan conflict, draping the NATO intervention under the UN flag. loc 1535</li>
<li>More decisive was the role played by France, the UK and Italy in the intervention, in order to secure the control of Libyan oil and gas, a critical supply for Western Europe. loc 1539</li>
<li>what appears clearly is that once the movement engages in military violence to counter military violence, it loses its character as a democratic movement to become a contender, sometimes as ruthless as its oppressors, in a bloody civil war. And any civil war may become an opportunity for geopolitical actors to increase their real estate, under whatever ideological mantle, loc 1542</li>
<li>civil wars not only kill people, they also kill social movements and their ideals of peace, democracy and justice. loc 1545 <strong>Note</strong>: consider role of social media in inciting violence-benghazi</li>
<li>Informed circles considered that, in 2012, the Free Syrian Army was in fact bankrolled and trained by the Saudis who had called openly in the Arab League for intervention in Syria. loc 1578</li>
<li>Internet networks provided a space of autonomy from where the movements emerged under different forms and with different results depending on their social context. loc 1588</li>
<li>in the case of the Arab uprisings, we can rely on a rigorous assessment of their role on the basis of social science research, thanks to the work that Philip Howard, Muhammad Hussain and their collaborators loc 1591 <strong>Note</strong>: look them up</li>
<li>Of course technology does not determine social movements or for that matter any social behavior. But Internet and mobile phone networks are not simply tools, but organizational forms, cultural expressions and specific platforms for political autonomy. loc 1594 <strong>Note</strong>: role of tech in society per castells</li>
<li>in his book The Digital Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Information Technology and Political Islam (2011), written before the Arab uprisings, Philip Howard, on the basis of a comparative analysis of 75 countries, either Muslim or with significant Muslim populations, finds that, while framed by a number of contextual factors, the diffusion and use of ICTs favor democratization, strengthen democracy and increase civic involvement and autonomy of the civil society, paving the way for the democratization of state and also for challenges to dictatorships. loc 1596</li>
<li>Digital media had a causal role in the Arab Spring in that they provided the fundamental infrastructure of a social movement unlike the others that have emerged in recent years in these countries. In the first few weeks of protest in each country, the generation of people in the streets – and its leadership – was clearly not interested in the three major models of political Islam … Instead, these mostly cosmopolitan and younger generations of mobilizers felt disenfranchised by their political systems, saw vast losses in the poor management of national economies and development, and most importantly, a consistent and widely shared narrative of common grievances – a narrative which they learned about from each other and co-wrote on the digital spaces of political writing and venting on blogs, videos shared on Facebook and Twitter, and comment board discussions on international news sites like Al Jazeera and the BBC. loc 1608 <strong>Note</strong>: hussain and howard research</li>
<li>It is true that Facebook and Twitter did not cause revolutions, but it is silly to ignore the fact that the careful and strategic uses of digital media to network regional publics, along with international support networks, have empowered activists in new ways that have led to some of the largest protests this decade in Iran, the temporary lifting of the Egyptian blockade on Gaza, and the popular movements that ended the decades long rule of Mubarak and Ben Ali. loc 1617</li>
<li>Digital media had a causal role in the Arab Spring in the sense that it provided the very infrastructure that created deep communication ties and organizational capacity in groups of activists before the major protests took place, and while street protests were being formalized. Indeed, it was because of those well-developed, digital networks, that civic leaders so successfully activated such large numbers of people to protest. loc 1620</li>
<li>Certainly there were different political outcomes, but that does not diminish the important role of digital media in the Arab Spring. But even more importantly, this investigation has illustrated that countries that don’t have a civil society equipped with digital scaffolding are much less likely to experience popular movements for democracy – an observation we are able to make only by accounting for the constellation of causal variables that existed before the street protests began, not simply the short-term uses of digital technologies during the short period of political upheaval. loc 1626</li>
<li>Digital networks and occupation of the urban space, in close interaction, provided the platform for autonomous organization and deliberation on which the uprisings were based, and created the resilience that was necessary for the movements to withstand ferocious assaults from state violence until the moment that, in some cases, out of a self-defence instinct, they became a counter-state. loc 1634</li>
<li>The power of images, and creative narrative-activated emotions, both mobilizing and soothing, created a virtual environment of art and meaning on which the activists of the movement could rely to connect with the youth population at large, thus changing culture as a tool of changing politics. loc 1639</li>
<li>The Arab uprisings were born at the dawn of the explosion of the digital age in the Arab world, albeit with different levels of diffusion of these communication technologies in various countries. Even in countries with low levels of Internet access, the core of activists that, as a network, networked the movement and the movement with their nation and the world, was organized and deliberated on the social networking sites. From that protected space, extensive mobile phone networks reached out to society at large. And because society was ready to receive certain messages about bread and dignity, people were moved and – ultimately – became a movement. loc 1643</li>

<li>OCCUPY WALL STREET: HARVESTING THE SALT OF THE EARTH loc 2409 <strong>Note</strong>: read this section later</li>
<li>in the historical experience, and in the observation of the movements analyzed in this book, social movements are most often triggered by emotions derived from some meaningful event that help the protesters to overcome fear and challenge the powers that be in spite of the danger inherent to their action. loc 3337</li>
<li>social change results from communicative action that involves connection between networks of neural networks from human brains stimulated by signals from a communication environment through communication networks. loc 3347</li>
<li>The use of Internet and mobile communication networks is essential, but the networking form is multimodal. loc 3368</li>
<li>decentered structure maximizes chances of participation in the movement, given that these are open-ended networks without defined boundaries, always reconfiguring themselves according to the level of involvement of the population at large. It also reduces the vulnerability of the movement to the threat of repression, since there are few specific targets to repress, except for the occupied sites, and the network can reform itself as long as there are enough participants in the movement, loosely connected by their common goals and shared values. loc 3375</li>
<li>Networking as the movement’s way of life protects the movement both against its adversaries and against its own internal dangers of bureaucratization and manipulation. loc 3379</li>
<li>The space of the movement is always made of an interaction between the space of flows on the Internet and wireless communication networks, and the space of places of the occupied sites and of symbolic buildings targeted by protest actions. This hybrid of cyberspace and urban space constitutes a third space that I call the space of autonomy. loc 3382</li>
<li>The space of autonomy is the new spatial form of networked social movements. loc 3387</li>
<li>Movements are local and global at the same time. loc 3388</li>
<li>movements are largely spontaneous in their origin, usually triggered by a spark of indignation either related to a specific event or to a peak of disgust with the actions of the rulers. loc 3403</li>
<li>The source of the call is less relevant than the impact of the message on the multiple, unspecified receivers, whose emotions connect with the content and form of the message. The power of images is paramount. loc 3406</li>
<li>Movements are viral, loc 3409</li>
<li>these are usually leaderless movements. Not because of the lack of would-be leaders, but because of the deep, spontaneous distrust of most participants in the movement towards any form of power delegation. This essential feature of the observed movements results directly from one of the causes of the movements: rejection of political representatives by the represented, after feeling betrayed and manipulated in their experience of politics as usual. loc 3414</li>
<li>This is at the same time an organizational procedure and a political goal: it is setting the foundations of a future real democracy by practicing it in the movement. loc 3420</li>
<li>community is a goal to achieve, but togetherness is a starting point and the source of empowerment: loc 3425</li>
<li>The horizontality of networks supports cooperation and solidarity while undermining the need for formal leadership. Thus, what appears to be an ineffective form of deliberation and decision-making is in fact the foundation needed to generate trust, without which no common action could be undertaken against the backdrop of a political culture characterized by competition and cynicism. loc 3426 <strong>Note</strong>: what about bystander effect?</li>
<li>These are highly self-reflective movements. loc 3431</li>
<li>This self-reflexivity is manifested in the process of assembly deliberations, but also in multiple forums on the Internet, in a myriad of blogs and group discussions on the social networks. loc 3434</li>
<li>Violence provides spectacular, selective footage for the media, and plays into the hands of those politicians and opinion leaders whose aim is to suppress as swiftly as possible the criticism embodied in the movement. loc 3446</li>
<li>These movements are rarely programmatic movements, except when they focus on a clear, single issue: down with the dictatorial regime. loc 3450</li>
<li>because demands are multiple and motivations unlimited, they cannot formalize any organization or leadership because their consensus, their togetherness, depends on ad hoc deliberation and protest, not on fulfilling a program built around specific goals: this is both their strength (wide open appeal), and their weakness (how can anything be achieved when the goals to be achieved are undefined?). loc 3452</li>
<li>they are social movements, aimed at changing the values of society, and they can also be public opinion movements, with electoral consequences. They aim to transform the state but not to seize the state. They express feelings and stir debate but do not create parties or support governments, although they may become a target of choice for political marketing. loc 3457</li>
<li>when societies fail in managing their structural crises by the existing institutions, change can only take place out of the system by a transformation of power relations that starts in people’s minds and develops in the form of the networks built by the projects of new actors constituting themselves as the subjects of the new history in the making. And the Internet that, like all technologies, embodies material culture, is a privileged platform for the social construction of autonomy. loc 3465</li>
<li>Neither the Internet, nor any other technology for that matter, can be a source of social causation. Social movements arise from the contradictions and conflicts of specific societies, and they express people’s revolts and projects resulting from their multidimensional experience. Yet, at the same time, it is essential to emphasize the critical role of communication in the formation and practice of social movements, now and in history. loc 3472 <strong>Note</strong>: important</li>
<li>people can only challenge domination by connecting with each other, by sharing outrage, by feeling togetherness, and by constructing alternative projects for themselves and for society at large. loc 3475</li>
<li>The digital social networks based on the Internet and on wireless platforms are decisive tools for mobilizing, for organizing, for deliberating, for coordinating and for deciding. Yet, the role of the Internet goes beyond instrumentality: it creates the conditions for a form of shared practice that allows a leaderless movement to survive, deliberate, coordinate and expand. loc 3481</li>
<li>I contend that the Internet provides the organizational communication platform to translate the culture of freedom into the practice of autonomy. This is because the technology of the Internet embodies the culture of freedom, as shown in the historical record of its development (Castells 2001). It was deliberately designed by scientists and hackers as a decentered, computer communication network able to withstand control from any command center. loc 3502</li>
<li>the most important activity on the Internet nowadays goes through social networking sites (SNS), and SNS have become platforms for all kinds of activities, not just for personal friendships or chatting but for marketing, e-commerce, education, cultural creativity, media and entertainment distribution, health applications, and, yes, socio-political activism. SNS are living spaces connecting all dimensions of people’s lives (Naughton 2012). loc 3512</li>
<li>the culture of freedom at the societal level, and the culture of individuation and autonomy at the level of social actors, induced at the same time the Internet networks and the networked social movements. Indeed, there is a synergistic effect between these two developments. loc 3526</li>
<li>There is indeed a virtuous circle between the technologies of freedom and the struggle to free the minds from the frames of domination. loc 3533</li>
<li>The consensus seems to be that, at the end of the day, the dreams of social change will have to be watered down, and channeled through the political institutions, either by reform or revolution. Even in the latter case, the revolutionary ideals will be interpreted (betrayed?) by the new powers in place and their new constitutional order. loc 3545</li>
<li>in most of the movements studied, and in similar movements around the world, the critical passage from hope to implementation of change depends on the permeability of political institutions to the demands of the movement, and on the willingness of the movement to engage in a process of negotiation. When both conditions are met in positive terms, a number of demands may be satisfied and political reform may happen, with different degrees of change. loc 3551 <strong>Note</strong>: req for success</li>
<li>influence of social movements on politics and policies is largely dependent upon their potential contribution to the pre-set agendas of political actors. loc 3561 <strong>Note</strong>: politics</li>
<li>Movements do not object to the principle of representative democracy, but denounce the practice of such democracy as it is today, and do not recognize its legitimacy. Under such conditions, there is little chance of a positive direct interaction between movements and the political class to push for political reform, that is a reform of the institutions of governance that would broaden the channels of political participation, and limit the influence of lobbies and pressure groups in the political system, the fundamental claims of most social movements. loc 3566</li>
<li>Since the road to policy changes goes through political change, and political change is shaped by the interests of the politicians in charge, the influence of the movement on policy is usually limited, at least in the short term, in the absence of a major crisis that requires the overhaul of the entire system, as happened in Iceland. loc 3575 <strong>Note</strong>: warning</li>
<li>love between social activism and political reformism does not appear to be impossible: it is simply hidden from the public view while citizens waver in their minds between desire and resignation. loc 3593 <strong>Note</strong>: hope</li>

<li>Even in the unlikely case that they transform themselves into a political actor, a party or some new form of agency, they will cease their existence by this very fact. Because the only relevant question to assess the meaning of a social movement is the social and historical productivity of its practice, and the effect on its participants as persons and on the society it tried to transform. loc 3692</li>
<li>we think differently about some critical dimensions of our personal and social lives, the institutions will have to yield at some point. loc 3698</li>
<li>there is an overarching theme, a pressing cry, a revolutionary dream, it is the call for new forms of political deliberation, representation and decision-making. This is because effective, democratic governance is a prerequisite for the fulfillment of all demands and projects. Because if citizens do not have the ways and means of their self-government, the best designed policies, the most sophisticated strategies, the more well-wishing programs may be ineffective or perverted in their implementation. The instrument determines the function. loc 3704</li>
<li>The legacy of networked social movements will have been to raise the possibility of re-learning how to live together. In real democracy. loc 3722</li>
