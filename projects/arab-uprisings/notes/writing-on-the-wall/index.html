  <h1 class="page-title">Notes | Writing on the Wall</h1>
  <ul>
<li>The technologies involved are very different, but these two forms of social media, separated by two millennia, share many of the same underlying structures and dynamics: they are two-way, conversational environments in which information passes horizontally from one person to another along social networks, rather than being delivered vertically from an impersonal central source.<br /> loc. 51</li>
<li>The advent of the steam-powered printing press, followed in the twentieth century by radio and television, made possible what we now call “mass media.” These new technologies of mass dissemination could supply information directly to large numbers of people with unprecedented speed and efficiency, but their high cost meant that control of the flow of information became concentrated in the hands of a select few. The delivery of information assumed a one-way, centralized, broadcast pattern that overshadowed the tradition of two-way, conversational, and social distribution that had come before. Vast media empires grew up around these mass-media technologies, which also fostered a sense of national identity and allowed autocratic governments to spread propaganda more easily than ever before.<br /> loc. 63</li>
<li>Does social media inherently promote freedom and democracy? What is the role of social media, if any, in triggering revolutions?<br /> loc. 75</li>
<li>Concerns about the trivialization of public discourse, and the belief that new forms of media are dangerously distracting, go back centuries, as do the debates about the regulation of social-media systems and their ability to bring about social and political change.<br /> loc. 80</li>
<li>many of the ways in which we share, consume, and manipulate information, even in the Internet era, build upon habits and conventions that date back centuries.<br /> loc. 86</li>
<li>social media does not merely connect us to each other today—it also links us to the past.<br /> loc. 89
*<em>Note: important consideration as i’m doing research for my project! *</em>
Human brains are social brains, tuned to analyze the shifting intentions and allegiances of friends and rivals within a group. Our brains were literally made for social networking.<br /> loc. 183</li>
<li>When Dunbar analyzed the brain sizes and group sizes for apes he concluded that, given the size of the human neocortex, the average group size for humans should be 148, which he rounded to 150. This number, which has become known as the “Dunbar number,”<br /> loc. 188</li>
<li>More fundamentally it is, Dunbar believes, the largest group size in which it is possible for everyone to know everyone else. Above that size, some people will be strangers to others. It is therefore the maximum number of people with whom it is possible to have a reciprocal personal relationship: you know them well enough that they would come to your aid if needed, and you would do the same for them.<br /> loc. 192</li>
<li>Collectively, the group can more easily detect members who take advantage of others, fail to share resources, or violate the group’s norms in other ways. The exchange of social information ensures that even those who do not witness bad behavior directly will soon learn about it, and the offending party can then be punished through ridicule or ostracism.<br /> loc. 216</li>
<li>Dunbar has gone so far as to suggest that the exchange of social information, rather than the need to pass on information about food sources or to coordinate hunting, was the driving force behind the development of language, because using language makes maintaining social bonds much more efficient—which in turn allows for larger (and safer) groups. He argues that “the most plausible starting point for the evolution of language is as a bonding device based on the exchange of social information concerning relationships within the social network.”<br /> loc. 222</li>
<li>Literacy was power.<br /> loc. 271</li>
<li>Writing was seen as a threat to the supremacy of the spoken word, which was central to Greek culture.<br /> loc. 305</li>
<li>Socrates complains that writing undermines the need to remember things and weakens the mind, creating “forgetfulness in the learners’ souls, because they will not use their memories;<br /> loc. 312</li>
<li>People who rely on written documents, he fears, will be “hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing.”<br /> loc. 317</li>
<li>that slaves were the Roman equivalent of broadband.<br /> loc. 360</li>
<li>“I write in one style what I expect that the persons addressed only, in another what I expect that many will read,”<br /> loc. 440</li>
<li>The earliest ancestor of the newspaper relied on informal distribution via social networks to reach a wide audience.<br /> loc. 451</li>
<li>The word diurna, meaning diurnal or daily, is the root of the English words “journal” and “journalism.”<br /> loc. 460</li>
<li>the poet Horace advised authors to wait nine years after completing a work before handing it out, to be sure that they were entirely happy with it, because “once your words are sent out you can’t recall them.”<br /> loc. 599</li>
<li>“SCRIPSIT QUI VOLUIT”—“Anyone who wanted to, wrote.”<br /> loc. 705</li>
<li>The first major work printed on Gutenberg’s press, an **ion of 180 copies of the Bible in Latin, sold out in advance of its release in 1455.<br /> loc. 852</li>
<li>Printing reached England in 1476, when William Caxton set up the first press at Westminster Abbey, near its scriptorium.<br /> loc. 861</li>
<li>Gutenberg’s printing press meant that ideas could be reproduced and circulated faster than ever before—as another German media pioneer, Martin Luther, was about to demonstrate.<br /> loc. 864</li>
<li>Luther had unwittingly revealed the power of a decentralized, person-to-person media system whose participants took care of distribution, deciding collectively which messages to amplify through sharing, recommendation, and copying.<br /> loc. 907</li>
<li>In a modern social-media system, the popularity of a given piece of content may be inferred from the number of Likes, retweets, reblogs, +Is, or page views it generates. The equivalent metric in Luther’s day was the number of separate **ions of a pamphlet—in other words, the number of times it was reprinted.<br /> loc. 924</li>
<li>the format also emphasized that it was up to ordinary people to weigh the arguments and reach their own conclusions. By their mere existence, Luther’s pamphlets embodied his belief that everyone should be allowed to participate in the debate about the reform of the church.<br /> loc. 956</li>
<li>“each man became eager for knowledge, not without feeling a sense of amazement at his former blindness.”<br /> loc. 960</li>
<li>News ballads were often “contrafacta” that deliberately mashed up a pious melody with secular or even profane lyrics.<br /> loc. 974</li>
<li>In a social-media system in which the audience participates in distribution, undesirable material is hard to control, and one cannot force something to spread if there is no demand for it.<br /> loc. 1017</li>
<li>Luther came to regard the press as a God-given instrument that had helped him succeed where Hus had failed a century earlier.<br /> loc. 1036</li>
<li>“it was the superabundance, the cascade of titles, that created the impression of an overwhelming tide, an unstoppable movement of opinion … Pamphlets and their purchasers had together created the impression of irresistible force.” Those<br /> loc. 1041</li>
<li>Scholars of the use of social media in modern revolutionary movements, such as those in Tunisia and Egypt, call this phenomenon “synchronization of opinion,” as social media helps people realize that their dissatisfaction with the status quo, which they have been reluctant to express, is shared by others.<br /> loc. 1044 *<em>**Note: tunisia and egypt</em>*</li>
<li>revolutionaries always find it easier to agree on what they want to get rid of than what they want to replace it with.<br /> loc. 1049</li>
<li>Pamphlets provided a medium for the wide distribution of Luther’s views, but the embrace of the Reformation in much of Germany depended on a combination of factors, including the spreading of Luther’s ideas in both spoken and printed form and the reluctance of the secular authorities to be pushed around by the church (something that was not the case in other parts of Europe, where the Reformation was effectively suppressed). Revolutions are ultimately caused by underlying grievances: oppression, political dissatisfaction, anger at corruption, and so forth. New forms of media do not trigger revolutions by themselves, but they can make it easier for would-be revolutionaries to coordinate their actions, synchronize opinion, and rally others to their cause.<br /> loc. 1066 *<em>**Note: role of media in revolutions</em>*</li>
<li>The mere act of sharing something can, in other words, be a form of self-expression.<br /> loc. 1250</li>
<li>The use of social media for self-expression and self-promotion is nothing new, but dates back at least as far as the Tudor court of the sixteenth century.<br /> loc. 1349</li>
<li>Today we think nothing of the ability to publish material online with a few clicks, or to read a wide variety of conflicting and unfiltered opinions. It is a freedom that has its roots in a fertile decade during which social media flowered in England, nearly four hundred years ago.<br /> loc. 1736</li>
<li>Coffee houses had successfully pushed back against regulation and defended their valued status as forums for free speech and the free exchange of ideas.<br /> loc. 1819</li>
<li>Coffee houses imposed order on the chaotic media environment of the time, sorting material by topic and making it much easier to find specific types of information, and people to discuss it with. Both pamphlets and people, to use the modern term, became more “discoverable.”<br /> loc. 1822</li>
<li>The social mixing that took place in coffee houses allowed ideas to leap over the boundaries of England’s class system, as the writer John Aubrey observed when he praised the “modern advantage of coffee houses … before which, men knew not how to be acquainted, but with their own relations, or societies.”<br /> loc. 1826</li>
<li>they lamented, like critics of social media today, that coffee houses were distracting people and encouraging them to waste time sharing trivia with their friends when they ought to be doing useful work.<br /> loc. 1856</li>
<li>On balance, the introduction of coffee houses did far more good than harm, which should give those concerned about the time-wasting potential of Internet-based social platforms pause for thought. What new ideas and unexpected connections might be brewing in Twitter’s global coffeehouse?<br /> loc. 1958</li>
<li>The practice of providing information about books, in the form of bibliographies, summaries, and reviews, was (along with the filing of useful snippets in miscellanies or commonplace books) one of the tactics intellectuals developed to deal with the feeling of information overload caused by the advent of printing.<br /> loc. 2006</li>
<li>Unable to query correspondents face to face, the Royal Society required that new correspondents be vouched for by existing ones who were known and trusted. In this way its network could be extended, one link at a time, through personal recommendations.<br /> loc. 2043</li>
<li>When Tim Berners-Lee, a British physicist working in Switzerland, created the World Wide Web in 1991, he did so with the aim of improving communication and collaboration among his fellow researchers. As with coffee houses, a social space first colonized by scientists turned out to have much broader appeal—and, with the endless mixing and remixing of ideas made possible by social media, has proved to be a crucible of technical and commercial innovation.<br /> loc. 2070</li>
<li>Ever since the colony’s founding in 1620, control of printed materials had been tight in Massachusetts, initially to ensure religious conformity.<br /> loc. 2093</li>
<li>“for learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world, and printing has divulged them, and libels against the best government. God keep us from both.”<br /> loc. 2100</li>
<li>As the publisher and printer of the Pennsylvania Gazette, encouraging the circulation of news in these various ways was in Franklin’s own commercial interests. But it also contributed to the dynamism, vitality, and unity of the American colonies’ emerging information ecosystem, with its constant traffic of letters, pamphlets, and newspapers. By the 1760s it had developed into a powerful, open, and social platform for the rehearsal of arguments, the propagation of ideas, and the exchange of opinions.<br /> loc. 2236</li>
<li>The success of Common Sense transformed attitudes toward independence, which had previously been something many people were reluctant to talk about, let alone support.<br /> loc. 2420</li>
<li>Like Luther’s pamphlets in the sixteenth century and Internet-based social media in the twenty-first, Common Sense acted as a means of signaling and synchronizing opinion.<br /> loc. 2464</li>
<li>In The History of the American Revolution, published in 1789, Ramsay came to the same conclusion. “In establishing American independence,” he declared, “the pen and the press had merit equal to that of the sword.”<br /> loc. 2472</li>
<li>“The Parisians had more of a propensity to believe the malicious rumors and libelles that circulated clandestinely than the facts printed and published by order or with the permission of the government.”<br /> loc. 2566</li>
<li>“authoritarian deliberation.” The authorities tolerate discussion within certain limits, providing a safety valve for discontent and advance warning of potential unrest, and only step in to censor sensitive topics or direct criticism of prominent members of the regime<br /> loc. 2679</li>
<li>China has constructed the most sophisticated scheme for monitoring and censoring social media in history, but it is unclear whether this situation is sustainable.<br /> loc. 2683</li>
<li>In the words of Robert Darnton, a historian who has studied the media system of pre-Revolutionary France in detail, “the media knit themselves together in a communication system so powerful that it proved to be decisive in the collapse of the regime.”<br /> loc. 2689</li>
<li>Earlier in the eighteenth century French political theorists such as the Baron de Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau had argued that true democracy was possible only in small cities, as in Ancient Greece, where the all citizens could gather in one place for discussion and collective decision making. But the more open media environment in Britain, and the effective use of the press during the American Revolution, suggested that printing offered a way to make democracy work at a national level, by allowing opinions to be shared and discussion to proceed over a wider area.<br /> loc. 2763</li>
<li>Printing, in other words, led to freedom.<br /> loc. 2770</li>
<li>“Blessed be the inventor of the printing press,” declared the political writer Louis-Charles de Lavicomterie. “It is to him that we owe this wondrous revolution.” Brissot wrote that if only everyone in the world spoke French, “the press would soon spread the French Revolution everywhere.”<br /> loc. 2783</li>
<li>“The Cercle Social is not a club … it is an association of citizens spread all over the globe,” declared its newsletter in February 1791.<br /> loc. 2798</li>
<li>despite the club’s inclusive rhetoric, most of its participants were well-to-do intellectuals, and the Cercle Social’s grandiose experiment came to an end in July 1791 amid the political crisis triggered by Louis XVI’s failed attempt to flee the country.<br /> loc. 2801</li>
<li>Condorcet, in his Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress of the Human Mind.<br /> loc. 2805</li>
<li>the press multiplies indefinitely, and at a small expense, copies of any work … facts and discoveries not only acquire a more extensive publicity, but acquire it also in a shorter space of time … What was read before by a few individuals only, might now be perused by a whole people … A public opinion is formed, powerful by the number of those who share in it, energetic, because the motives that determine it act upon all minds at once, though at considerable distances from each other. A tribunal is erected in favor of reason and justice, independent of all human power, from the penetration of which it is difficult to conceal any thing, from whose verdict there is no escape … Every new error is resisted from its birth; frequently attacked before it has disseminated itself, it has not time to take root in the mind.<br /> loc. 2815</li>
<li>“All our past, present and future calamities have always been and will always be uniquely her work,” declared one of the many accounts of her life.<br /> loc. 2843</li>
<li>All were depicted as evil super-villains manipulating events to their own advantage before eventually being undone by honest revolutionaries.<br /> loc. 2846</li>
<li>instead of attacking their subjects using ridicule, the tone is one of simple denunciation;<br /> loc. 2848</li>
<li>When Condorcet asserted that the press established “a new kind of authority … from which is exercised a less tyrannical empire over the passions but a more firm and lasting power over reason,” Adams noted that “the empire of the press, over the passions, in the hands of Marat and others was more tyrannical than the government of Cesar Borgia.” Condorcet suggested that “every new error is resisted from its birth,” but Adams responded that “there has been more error propagated from the press in the last ten years than in a hundred years before.”<br /> loc. 2854</li>
<li>In retrospect, the problem was that revolutionary leaders such as Mirabeau, Brissot, and Condorcet assumed that the removal of controls on printing would allow the inherent but unspoken unity of public opinion to express itself. But instead the press revealed and amplified the differences between the various revolutionary factions.<br /> loc. 2859 *<em>**Note: exactly this!</em>*</li>
<li>A free society requires a free media system, but the lesson of the French Revolution is that a free media system on its own will not necessarily result in a free society.<br /> loc. 2866 *<em>**Note: agreed</em>*</li>
<li>With steam printing, information had become an industrial product.<br /> loc. 2891</li>
<li>The stamp duty was condemned by publishers as a “tax on knowledge,” and some radical newspapers were produced illegally, without paying it.<br /> loc. 2898</li>
<li>Wider literacy created the market for the penny papers, but they in turn accelerated the advance of literacy by providing ordinary people with something they wanted to read.<br /> loc. 2963</li>
<li>One man has as good a right as another to have his wares, his goods, his panaceas, his profession, published to the world in a newspaper, provided he pays for it.<br /> loc. 2974</li>
<li>Readers were no longer seen as participants in a conversation taking place within the newspaper’s pages; instead they had become purely consumers of information and, potentially, of the products and services offered by advertisers. Rather than providing a platform for the circulation and discussion of documents created by others, newspapers became vehicles for the delivery of their own reports.<br /> loc. 3040</li>
<li>Telegraphers often made friends over the wires; romances between operators who met each other online were not unknown. Such was the sense of online camaraderie that some operators in remote places preferred to commune with their friends on the wires than with the local people.<br /> loc. 3087</li>
<li>for society as a whole, rather than being a medium of direct personal interaction with others, the telegraph was quite the opposite, because it further centralized the impersonal flow of information.<br /> loc. 3099</li>
<li>Speed was everything; newspapers came to value timeliness at the expense of depth.<br /> loc. 3115</li>
<li>Over the course of the nineteenth century the newspaper evolved from being a handmade, local publication into the product of a vast, powerful, and lucrative industry. In the process its capacity to act as a platform for discussion within a community was greatly diminished, and it became almost exclusively a one-way medium.<br /> loc. 3183</li>
<li>media became a product to be passively consumed, rather than an environment in which to actively participate.<br /> loc. 3187</li>
<li>there was “little necessity for argument, for the staggering disaster of the Titanic, coupled with the wireless chaos concerning relief work and accurate reports, was in itself a demonstration which will serve for all time to show that regulation is imperative.” The engineer in chief of the navy, Hutch Cone, told the Herald that “If there ever was a demonstration that regulation of wireless is necessary, this is it.”<br /> loc. 3288</li>
<li>“No other country in the world may boast so large an army of amateur wireless men as America,” it declared. “It was estimated before the war that there were at least 175,000 amateur stations scattered far and wide throughout the United States. Now that peace is assured the number will probably be even greater … With the increased facilities for long-distance work the American boy becomes in a sense a citizen of the world. From his home station, probably constructed in his study room, he enjoys a power which a generation ago would have seemed magical.”<br /> loc. 3313 *<em>**Note: “wireless men”</em>*</li>
<li>Goebbels was explicit about radio’s potential to effect political and societal change: “The radio will be for the twentieth century what the press was for the nineteenth century,” he declared. Under the Weimar Republic the government had been “blind to the possibilities of this modern method of influencing the masses … We on the other hand intend a principled transformation in the worldview of our entire society, a revolution of the greatest possible extent that will leave nothing out, changing the life of our nation in every regard … It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio and the airplane.”<br /> loc. 3432</li>
<li>After the war Albert Speer, one of Hitler’s ministers, told the Nuremberg trials: “Hitler’s dictatorship differed in one fundamental point from all its predecessors in history. His was the first dictatorship … which made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, eighty million people were deprived of independent thought. It was thereby possible to subject them to the will of one man.”<br /> loc. 3455</li>
<li>In the United States radio listeners were gathered up by networks that saw them as consumers to be sold to; in Britain they were the masses to be instructed and improved; in Germany they were the people to be indoctrinated and misled. In each case there was a striking “us and them” division between broadcasters and the faceless mass of their listeners.<br /> loc. 3460
*<em>Note: “us” and “them” *</em>
Radio took six years to go from 10 percent to 40 percent penetration, from early adopters to mainstream acceptance; television took just three.<br /> loc. 3576</li>
<li>the United States was the unquestioned leader in the development, adoption, and usage of television.<br /> loc. 3580</li>
<li>The networks’ desire to maximize their audience ratings, and hence their advertising revenue, led critics to argue that the early promise of television, as a medium that would promote education and strengthen democracy, had been thrown away.<br /> loc. 3581</li>
<li>Television was seen as an opportunity to extend the perception of the average American, to open for all the great excitement and education and self-fulfilling potential that can come from exposure to the best that man has to offer. By now almost everyone, including those in the industry, would concede that television has failed. Not only has it failed to make of us a better race of men, it has actually made us worse than we were before. The former would be indictment enough. The latter is simply intolerable.<br /> loc. 3585</li>
<li>Television was blamed for causing crime and social disharmony.<br /> loc. 3590</li>
<li>In Amusing Ourselves to Death, published in 1985, the American media theorist Neil Postman likened the situation to that depicted in Aldous Huxley’s novel Brave New World, in which the people were oppressed not by an authoritarian government, but by their addiction to entertainment.<br /> loc. 3591</li>
<li>Watching television, an entirely one-way, passive experience, became the very definition of inaction. Only sleeping involves less effort. The broadcast model considers the role of the radio listener and television viewer to be merely that of a passive consumer. This is as far as it is possible to be from a media system in which people create, distribute, share, and rework information and exchange it with each other. It is the opposite of social media.<br /> loc. 3598</li>
<li>The Internet is proving to be one of the most powerful amplifiers of speech ever invented. It offers a global megaphone for voices that might otherwise be heard only feebly, if at all. It invites and facilitates multiple points of view and dialogue in ways unimplementable by the traditional, one-way, mass media. —Vinton Cerf, 2002<br /> loc. 3604</li>
<li>The practice of linking entire networks, rather than individual computers, came to be known as “internetworking” or “internetting.”<br /> loc. 3669</li>
<li>The volume of Usenet traffic grew rapidly during the 1980s as the distinction faded between the military ARPANET and the wider Internet. And it was in newsgroups that flame wars (heated exchanges of messages), acronyms (such as LOL for “laugh out loud”), the custom of compiling lists of answers to “frequently asked questions” (FAQs), and the use of “emoticons” such as :-) first became widespread.<br /> loc. 3714</li>
<li>The very first web pages, created by Berners-Lee in 1990, did not contain images, just monochrome text with a choice of font sizes and styles. Crucially, however, text on one web page could be highlighted and turned into a clickable link to another page or document, either on the same computer or on a remote machine.<br /> loc. 3739</li>
<li>Berners-Lee had designed the web to encourage collaboration by scientists, providing a new place for people and ideas to meet, just as they had previously in coffee houses, at scientific societies, and in the pages of scientific journals.<br /> loc. 3755</li>
<li>In December 2002 political bloggers were instrumental in causing Trent Lott, the U.S. Senate Republican leader, to resign after he made remarks at a party that were taken to indicate his support for the policy of racial segregation. Lott’s controversial remarks received very little coverage in the conventional media, but they were seized upon by bloggers who kept the story alive and dug up other examples of Lott saying similar things. This prompted the news media to reexamine the story and give it more coverage. Lott issued an apology in a vain effort to draw a line under the affair, but he ended up resigning a few days later.<br /> loc. 3814</li>
<li>bloggers in America came to see themselves as an alternative, and a corrective, to the mainstream media (commonly referred to as the MSM).<br /> loc. 3819</li>
<li>the same is true of journalists, as bloggers have shown. As Harold Evans, former **or of the Times of London, told the Wall Street Journal in 2007, “some blogs have become the best check on monopoly mainstream journalism, and they provide a surprisingly frequent source of initiative reporting.”<br /> loc. 3841</li>
<li>By the end of 2006 there were more than one billion people using the Internet, compared with around forty million blogs.<br /> loc. 3847</li>
<li>The stream-based display of updates, popularized by Facebook’s news feed, spawned another approach to the social exchange of information, known as “microblogging,” in which brief messages and status updates from friends and contacts are displayed in a reverse-chronological feed. This model was pioneered by Twitter, a start-up cofounded in 2006 by Evan Williams, one of the founders of Blogger. It began when Jack Dorsey, another of Twitter’s cofounders, realized that the status updates commonly posted on social networks and instant-messaging systems would be much more useful and informative if people could update them when they were away from their computers.<br /> loc. 3902</li>
<li>For technical reasons text messages are limited to one hundred and sixty characters in length, of which twenty characters were reserved for the user name and routing information, leaving one hundred and forty characters for each message, or “tweet.” This limitation, forcing people to be concise, was kept in place when Twitter was launched as an Internet-based service in July 2006.<br /> loc. 3908</li>
<li>In a speech at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy in November 2012, Dick Costolo, Twitter’s chief executive, likened it to a global town square, a reinvention of the Roman Forum or Greek Agora in which people can exchange views directly, rather than getting information from a small number of centralized, filtered sources such as newspapers, radio, and television.<br /> loc. 3919</li>
<li>The microblogging approach pioneered by Twitter has proved particularly popular in China, where Twitter itself is banned, but where similar microblogging services, called weibo, have been set up by local Internet firms. Tencent Weibo, Sina Weibo, and Netease Weibo all have hundreds of millions of users, with more than half of China’s six hundred million Internet users using at least one of them. Microblogging works particularly well in China because smartphones (rather than PCs) are the most popular Internet-access devices. And Chinese allows many words to be expressed using very few characters, making it possible to fit an entire paragraph into a single weibo post.<br /> loc. 3932</li>
<li>Given how widely used social sites have become, it is hardly surprising that, like earlier forms of social media, they have started to have social and political impact, particularly in countries where publishing has traditionally been tightly restricted.<br /> loc. 3946</li>
<li>On December 17, 2010, a twenty-six-year-old Tunisian fruit seller, Mohamed Bouazizi, had his produce and weighing scales confiscated by police in his home town of Sidi Bouzid.<br /> loc. 3949</li>
<li>State-run media made no mention of Bouazizi’s action, but pictures of him in his hospital bed, and mobile-phone footage of the protests, began spreading on Facebook, YouTube, blogs, and other social sites.<br /> loc. 3954</li>
<li>One such video was seen on Facebook by journalists at Al Jazeera, a satellite-news broadcaster based in Qatar and the Arab world’s most influential media outlet. Al Jazeera showed the video on air, giving it not just national but international prominence.<br /> loc. 3956</li>
<li>Previous protests, such as that in the town of Ben Guerdane a few months earlier, had been quickly and brutally stifled by the police, preventing news of any unrest from spreading. But this time was different. By the time Bouazizi died of his burns on January 4, 2011, antigovernment protests had broken out across the country.<br /> loc. 3959</li>
<li>Bouazizi’s cousin Ali, who, along with another family member, had recorded the first protest on his mobile phone, later explained, “We tried to record everything that happened, and to broadcast it through the Internet, because Tunisian media always silenced us. We were the first to send these pictures, which had an important echo around the world.”<br /> loc. 3965</li>
<li>On January 14 Ben Ali fled the country, bringing to an end his twenty-three-year rule. The success of the Tunisian uprising inspired similar protests across the Arab world.<br /> loc. 3968</li>
<li>In Egypt, as in Tunisia, there was a thriving underground network of young activists well versed in the use of blogs and other forms of social media and connected to a foreign diaspora of sympathizers. In 2010 they had helped spread images of Khaled Said, a twenty-eight-year-old Egyptian who had been beaten to death by two policemen, apparently for posting online a video of corrupt police officers engaged in a drug deal. The initial police report claimed that Said had suffocated after taking drugs, but a member of his family obtained a mobile-phone picture of his badly beaten body and shared it online, causing an outcry.<br /> loc. 3969</li>
<li>Wael Ghonim, a twenty-nine-year-old Egyptian who worked for Google in Dubai, to create a Facebook page called “We Are All Khaled Said.” Created under the pseudonym “ElShaheed” (“The martyr”),<br /> loc. 3974</li>
<li>They stood silently together to avoid falling foul of Egypt’s emergency law, which banned the chanting of slogans. The page also advocated writing “No to Torture, No to the Emergency Law” on Egyptian banknotes, so that this slogan would circulate as money passed from hand to hand.<br /> loc. 3978</li>
<li>Ghonim posted a message on the page inviting Egyptians to take to the streets on January 25, a forthcoming national holiday. The page became a rallying point for activist groups, bringing together a number of calls for a day of antigovernment protests.<br /> loc. 3981</li>
<li>The nationwide protests that followed, coordinated in part via mobile phones and social media, prompted the government to shut down the country’s communications networks entirely on January 26. This was a mistake, Ghonim says, because it showed that the government was scared. “Fear was the main reason that the regime was still going. But when you cut the Internet you are telling everyone you are scared. So people took to the streets because they thought: we are stronger.”<br /> loc. 3983</li>
<li>after two weeks of continuous protest against his rule, Mubarak resigned on February 11, 2011.<br /> loc. 3990</li>
<li>Naguib Sawiris, an Egyptian telecommunications billionaire who backed the uprising, applauded “what this technology has done to my part of the world. Ninety percent of the success of this revolution is attributed to it.”<br /> loc. 3990</li>
<li>A study of weibo censorship by Dan Wallach and his colleagues at Rice University in Houston, Texas, published in March 2013, concluded that there were more than four thousand censors working around the clock in eight-hour shifts to monitor the seventy thousand weibo messages posted every minute. The total number of people involved in the internet-censorship system, known as “Golden Shield,” is estimated to be around one hundred thousand.<br /> loc. 4000</li>
<li>The People’s Daily Online, an affiliate of the Communist party’s main newspaper, analyzes social media to compile a weekly report called “Online Public Sentiment,” which is available only to senior officials.<br /> loc. 4005</li>
<li>And despite the constraints on the use of weibo and other Internet forums, the toleration of political discussion within certain limits has undoubtedly given people a new means by which to express their concerns and has made it harder for the government to conceal or ignore incompetence and corruption.<br /> loc. 4009</li>
<li>The advent of weibo has given Chinese users a newfound freedom to express themselves, but within limits that are still carefully circumscribed by the government.<br /> loc. 4020</li>
<li>In Tunisia and Egypt, young people who lacked jobs and economic opportunity, and felt they had nothing to lose, led the calls for the removal of their despotic leaders. In China, by contrast, middle-class Internet users are worried that the wealth they have accumulated during China’s rapid economic development is in danger of appropriation by corrupt officials and a capricious and inconsistent application of the law. Their political engagement is a consequence of wealth, not poverty. As a result, the smartphone-toting Chinese middle class and the ruling elite have, to some extent, a common interest in a gradual process of steady reform, rather than a cataclysmic political upheaval.<br /> loc. 4023</li>
<li>Today’s social media can be seen as the culmination of a long historical trend that has gradually extended the ability to share one’s thoughts with others to a larger and larger proportion of the population. It seems likely that it will not be many years before the whole world has access to the social publishing medium of the Internet.<br /> loc. 4036</li>
<li>By making it quick and easy for anyone to share information with others, modern social media gives ordinary people a collective agenda-setting power that was previously restricted to large publishers and broadcasters, and that is capable of striking fear into those in authority. Working out the implications and long-term consequences of this new media environment is the giant collective experiment in which humanity is now engaged. We are still only at the very beginning of the process. But history can provide some helpful clues.<br /> loc. 4041</li>
<li>In many respects twenty-first-century Internet media has more in common with seventeenth-century pamphlets or eighteenth-century coffee houses than with nineteenth-century newspapers or twentieth-century radio and television. New media is very different from old media, in short, but has much in common with “really old” media.<br /> loc. 4054</li>
<li>the historical forms of social media have enough in common with the modern sort—in their underlying social mechanisms, the reactions they provoked, and the impact they had on society—that they can help us reassess social media today, and the contemporary debates it has engendered.<br /> loc. 4061</li>
<li>the debate over the political impact of social media and its role in triggering protests and revolutions.<br /> loc. 4064</li>
<li>On the one hand are those, like Shirky, who point to the use of social media by activists and revolutionary movements, notably in Tunisia and Egypt, but also elsewhere; on the other are those, like the writers Malcolm Gladwell and Evgeny Morozov, who have expressed skepticism that online support for a cause will necessarily translate into real-world action. Indeed, skeptics argue, supporting a cause online may even make people less likely to take action, because they may then feel they have done their bit (what Morozov likes to call “slacktivism”).<br /> loc. 4065</li>
<li>that its main function was to reveal and synchronize public opinion and expose the extent of the opposition to the incumbent regime. In each case, simmering resentments meant that revolution would have happened sooner or later anyway; the use of social media merely helped the process along. It is wrong to attribute revolutions entirely to social media, in other words, but it is also wrong to discount its role altogether.<br /> loc. 4071 *<em>**Note: agreed</em>*</li>
<li>Jared Cohen, a former official in America’s State Department who now works for Google, has likened social media’s role in the Arab Spring to that of an “accelerant” that causes fire to spread more quickly.<br /> loc. 4075</li>
<li>New forms of social media did not start the fire in either the sixteenth or twenty-first centuries. But in both cases it helped turn an initial spark into a conflagration.<br /> loc. 4078 *<em>**Note: exactly</em>*</li>
<li>A related question is whether greater access to the Internet, and to the open publishing environment provided by social media in particular, inherently promotes freedom and democracy.<br /> loc. 4080</li>
<li>Greater freedom of expression certainly makes life more difficult for repressive regimes. But as events in Condorcet’s time showed, unfettered publishing also makes it easier for governments to monitor public opinion and keep tabs on dissidents; and as the aftermath of the French Revolution demonstrated, in a lawless environment a free press can be exploited by populists, leading to mob rule.<br /> loc. 4085 *<em>**Note: absolutely</em>*</li>
<li>it helps governments spread propaganda and makes possible new forms of surveillance, by making it easier to identify connections between activists.<br /> loc. 4089 *<em>**Note: like mexican cartels</em>*</li>
<li>“the emergence of new digital spaces for dissent also leads to new ways of tracking it … getting access to an activist’s inbox puts all their interlocutors in the frame, too.”<br /> loc. 4093</li>
<li>oppressive regimes often rely on manipulating their citizens’ view of the world, and a more open media environment makes that harder to accomplish.<br /> loc. 4095</li>
<li>social media can make repression easier, too.<br /> loc. 4097</li>
<li>Morozov notes, the Internet “penetrates and reshapes all walks of political life, not just the ones conducive to democratization.” Anyone who hopes that the Internet will spread Western-style liberal democracy must bear in mind that the same digital tools have also been embraced by campaigners with very different aims, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and ultra-right-wing nationalist groups in Russia.<br /> loc. 4097
*<em>**Note: and ISIL</em>*</li>
<li>the history of media shows that this is just the modern incarnation of the timeless complaint of the intellectual elite, every time technology makes publishing easier, that the wrong sort of people will use it to publish the wrong sorts of things.<br /> loc. 4108</li>
<li>Those in authority always squawk, it seems, when access to publishing is broadened. Greater freedom of expression, as John Milton noted in Areopagitica, means that bad ideas will proliferate as well as good ones, but it also means that bad ideas are more likely to be challenged. Better to provide an outlet for bigotry and prejudice, so they can be argued against and addressed, than to pretend that such views, and the people who hold them, do not exist.<br /> loc. 4119 *<em>**Note: i like this</em>*</li>
<li>Zeynep Tufekci, a media theorist at Princeton University, suggests that the popularity of social media stems from its ability to reconnect people in a world of suburbanization, long working hours, and families scattered around the globe by migration. Social media, she argues, is also a welcome antidote to the lonely, one-way medium of television. People who use social media can stay in contact with people they would otherwise lose touch with and make contact with like-minded individuals they might otherwise have never met. “Social media is enhancing human connectivity as people can converse in ways that were once not possible,” Tufekci argues.<br /> loc. 4164</li>
<li>the technology that is demonized today may end up being regarded as wholesome and traditional tomorrow, by which time another apparently dangerous new invention will be causing the same concerns.<br /> loc. 4181</li>
<li>Even though Facebook, Twitter, and other social platforms provide a way for people to share information by sharing along social connections, they still resemble old-fashioned media companies such as newspapers and broadcasters in two ways: they are centralized (even though the distribution of information is carried out by the users, rather than the platform owners) and they rely on advertising for the majority of their revenue.<br /> loc. 4183</li>
<li>The contrast between big social platforms on the one hand, and e-mail and the web on the other, is striking. Both e-mail and web publishing work in an entirely open, decentralized way.<br /> loc. 4193</li>
<li>If you are setting up a new blog or website, there are also plenty of companies to choose from who will host it for you, and you can move from one to another if you are unsatisfied with their service. None of this is true for social networking, however, which takes place inside huge, proprietary silos owned by private companies.<br /> loc. 4197</li>
<li>perhaps the core features of social networking and social media—maintaining lists of friends, and exchanging information with them—will move to an open, decentralized model.<br /> loc. 4204</li>
<li>“I think it’s important to design new systems that work in a distributed way,” says Tim Berners-Lee. “We must make systems in which people can collaborate together, but do it in a way that’s decentralized, so it’s not based on one central hub.”<br /> loc. 4211<strong>Note: !</strong></li>
<li>social media is not new. It has been around for centuries. Today, blogs are the new pamphlets. Microblogs and online social networks are the new coffee houses. Media-sharing sites are the new commonplace books. They are all shared, social platforms that enable ideas to travel from one person to another, rippling through networks of people connected by social bonds, rather than having to squeeze through the privileged bottleneck of broadcast media. The rebirth of social media in the Internet age represents a profound shift—and a return, in many respects, to the way things used to be.<br /> loc. 4223 <strong>Note: good summary</strong></li>
