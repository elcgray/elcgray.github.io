  <h4><span id="mcmurray">McMurray, D., &amp; Ufheil-Somers, A. (2013). <i>The Arab Revolts: Dispatches on Militant Democracy in the Middle East (Public Cultures of the Middle East and North Africa)</i> (Kindle). Indiana University Press.</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>The 2011 eruptions of popular discontent in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, and Syria represent local manifestations of a regional mass movement for democracy, freedom and human dignity. In a region ruled by varying forms of authoritarianism since the end of European colonialism, the insurrectionary spark from Tunisia ignited a fiery mix of anger and hope that had been heretofore suppressed. Aided by newer forms of transnational communication and cultural exchange like Al Jazeera and satellite television, people across the Arab world saw the problems of corrupt, anti-democratic government and growing poverty multiplied across the region. A shared sense of suffering—a perhaps unexpected corollary of pan-Arabism—united people across national boundaries and strengthened the idea of “the people” (sha‘b) as distinct from the state. Thus the slogans and demands expressed in different vernaculars reflect the same core ideas.<strong>loc</strong> 143</li>
<li>They want to be free of brutalization, they want accountability for those wielding power, and they want to be respected citizens of nations legitimately governed. They want jobs, decent wages, public services, and other basic economic and human rights.<strong>loc</strong> 151</li>
<li>the revolts were also shaped by particular histories and social contexts.<strong>loc</strong> 153</li>
<li>The extent to which outside forces became involved, in conjunction with the sometimes shifting loyalty of internal and external allies of the respective regimes as they battled resistance also played an important part in giving each uprising its unique character and trajectory.<strong>loc</strong> 156   <strong>Note:</strong> role of outside forces</li>
<li>Relatively stagnant economic systems made worse by the 2008 financial crisis and recent rises in food prices, combined with relatively high unemployment—especially among educated youth—poorly managed public services, and rampant corruption created systems of entrenched and pervasive social inequality. Metastasizing security apparatuses inserted themselves into ever more aspects of daily life and impinged upon higher levels of the social spectrum. Though some countries saw a lessening of election fraud that allowed opposition parties into parliaments, constitutional acrobatics were institutionalizing the rule of autocrats and their family members. The increasingly organized opposition to declining living conditions and political freedoms, however, provided people with experiences and strategies that proved essential for the 2011 uprisings.<strong>loc</strong> 168   <strong>Note:</strong> shared underlying conditions</li>
<li>The region faced a comprehensive crisis of governance.<strong>loc</strong> 176   <strong>Note:</strong> failed governance as threat</li>
<li>rising unemployment and increasing poverty over the last twenty years have sharpened the divides between elites—often ensconced in glittering gated communities—and the rest, the middle and working classes and the peasantry who live in increasingly crowded and underserved cities and towns.<strong>loc</strong> 180   <strong>Note:</strong> polarized classes</li>
<li>states, the better social and economic future promised by post-independence governments seemed to materialize only for the well-connected.<strong>loc</strong> 183</li>
<li>The region has been dramatically—though unevenly—transformed by the privatization and globalization of national economies under the influence of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other advocates of neoliberal policies.<strong>loc</strong> 184</li>
<li>For states seeking international loans, monies were conditioned upon shifting economic activity toward export-oriented agriculture, manufacturing, and services as well as selling state-owned corporations to private investors—the standard recipe for structural adjustment.<strong>loc</strong> 188   <strong>Note:</strong> one size fits all?</li>
<li>Such programs often served parallel regime interests by rewarding political allies with privileged access to formerly public assets and new markets.<strong>loc</strong> 193</li>
<li>In some cases, “privatization” was merely a reorganization of ownership such that certain sectors of the regime remained in control.<strong>loc</strong> 195</li>
<li>Structural adjustment requires the reduction of state spending as an end in itself, though as some states (Egypt and Tunisia) became increasingly indebted to foreign lenders, cutting public investments in education, health care and pensions also freed more capital for debt servicing. Fluctuations in the price of oil put budgetary pressures on all of the states under consideration, whose economies are intricately linked to oil through either direct export, taxation, the remittances of migrant laborers working in more oil-rich countries (namely Saudi Arabia) or a combination of all these factors.<strong>loc</strong> 199</li>
<li>In the nominally republican regimes, the role of the president’s family became increasingly prominent during the period of structural adjustment as key industries were sold to or controlled by members of the ruling family. In Egypt, Mubarak’s son Gamal became the official face of restructuring through his leadership of various National Democratic Party and government organs responsible for economic liberalization, not to mention his social clique of wealthy financiers with links to US companies.1 In Tunisia, the near-exclusive control the extended families of Ben Ali and his wife, Leila Trabelsi, exercised over all sectors of the economy alienated larger and larger segments of the middle class.<strong>loc</strong> 208   <strong>Note:</strong> egypt and tunisia</li>
<li>jumlukiyya, coined by Egyptian intellectual Saad Edin Ibrahim to describe the masking of monarchy (malakiyya) with the trappings of republicanism (jumhuriyya).<strong>loc</strong> 214</li>
<li>The upward flow of public wealth into private coffers has spawned both conspicuous and hidden forms of inequality.<strong>loc</strong> 220</li>
<li>Statistics on unemployment and poverty were often similarly skewed in state-sponsored reports. Consumption inequality was easier to observe.<strong>loc</strong> 224</li>
<li>The rise of neoliberal economic strategies coupled with the general decline across the region of command economies, fewer pro-peasant and pro-worker policies, and deteriorating public services did not alone ignite the Arab uprisings. As those elements of the socioeconomic compact began to wither away, coercive apparatuses became increasingly important for regime survival. Expressions of political frustration were met with ever-harsher methods of surveillance and oppression.<strong>loc</strong> 230   <strong>Note:</strong> complex system</li>
<li>Shakedowns or spying by the local police, visits from the mukhabarat (intelligence services), encounters with riot police or baltagiyya (mercenary thugs)—these activities enforced domestic tranquility through fear, intimidation, arbitrary arrest, torture and sometimes public displays of violence.<strong>loc</strong> 235   <strong>Note:</strong> blatant violence</li>
<li>In both Tunisia and Egypt, the military refused to fire live ammunition on protesters and broke publicly with the regimes.<strong>loc</strong> 239   <strong>Note:</strong> role of military</li>
<li>The power of the military in Tunisia has been tightly controlled since Habib Bourguiba’s presidency, with the effect of maintaining the institution’s professionalism, while the independent political and economic interests of the Egyptian military were best preserved by cutting ties with Mubarak and forcing him to relinquish power.<strong>loc</strong> 240</li>
<li>Ben Ali had used employment in the police force as a kind of economic stimulus as the effects of structural adjustment and regime cronyism devastated the country’s middle and working classes. Yet low pay and other grievances failed to secure the allegiance of most workaday police officers, many of whom joined in the protests within the first few weeks.<strong>loc</strong> 243</li>
<li>Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US-led war on terror provided funding and political cover to regimes looking for more resources to suppress internal dissent. Ben Ali and Mubarak had long emphasized the threat of domestic and international Islamist groups to justify crackdowns on political freedoms and state violence. After 2011, the United States provided materiel (light and heavy weaponry, tear gas) and training (investigation, interrogation, counterterrorism) to expand regime campaigns against armed and peaceful opposition alike.<strong>loc</strong> 251   <strong>Note:</strong> US role</li>
<li>As the security networks grew and the targets of repression multiplied, state violence became visible to wider swaths of the population. State police in Tunisia turned to harassing women with headscarves, gathering intelligence on mosque activities and worshippers, and occasionally rounding up youth and holding them merely on the suspicion that they were involved in “terrorist activities.”<strong>loc</strong> 264<br></li>
<li>Though Egypt’s emergency law had codified police impunity for three decades, in the last few years of the Mubarak regime, incidents of arbitrary arrest and torture became so common and well-documented that the regime stopped denying that torture occurred.3 Growing discontent with the police state was catalyzed in June 2010 when Alexandria police officers dragged a young man named Khalid Sa‘id out of an internet cafe and beat him to death in public during a petty drug arrest.<strong>loc</strong> 269</li>
<li>The murder inspired a “We Are All Khalid Sa‘id” Facebook page and protest movement that staged demonstrations over the summer and fall of 2010 against police brutality and human rights abuses. This organization became a major promoter of the demonstrations on January 25, 2011.<strong>loc</strong> 275</li>
<li>In the countries that did hold elections, uncontested polls, voter intimidation and outright fraud were rife. Constitutions were amended to allow aging presidents to run again.<strong>loc</strong> 287</li>
<li>Membership in Tunisia’s Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique (RCD) was practically a requirement for public service, from municipal workers to university administrators, and conferred extra perks like business permits and university scholarships.8<strong>loc</strong> 295</li>
<li>Egypt’s National Democratic Party, in contrast, served as a patronage network rather than an ideological organization. Party membership was more important for strongmen of the hinterlands and ambitious entrepreneurs than for civil servants or average Egyptians.<strong>loc</strong> 298</li>
<li>In Tunisia, most independent organizations working on human rights and women’s issues were absorbed by the state and transformed into committees headed by RCD appointees.<strong>loc</strong> 303</li>
<li>The Egyptian government still has the power to dissolve and seize the assets of groups it deems non-compliant, and a bill proposed by the newly-elected legislature in April 2012 would essentially transform NGOs into appendages of the state and classify their employees as civil servants.<strong>loc</strong> 308</li>
<li>Contrary to the narrative that prevailed in the Western press, none of the revolts sprang spontaneously from a crowd of disaffected youth. The revolts were not the product of people who suddenly decided they had had enough, though public actions and confrontations with the police did energize and radicalize many who were not veterans of previous opposition activities. Rather, the uprisings grew out of varied histories of collective action.<strong>loc</strong> 322   <strong>Note:</strong> background</li>
<li>Humiliation and rage can bring about wildcat actions or foster demonstrations, but they do not build into full-scale rebellions without the experience of collective action provided by years or even decades of organizing to coordinate and carry out resistance.<strong>loc</strong> 326</li>
<li>Some commentators have privileged the role played by new social media in promoting the collective action necessary to sustain the uprisings. The importance of Twitter and Facebook in organizing Egyptian and Tunisian demonstrations cannot be denied. The fact that the Syrian security forces make house-to-house searches confiscating cell phones so they will not be used to upload videos of the violence is further proof of the centrality of new media in the struggle. That all of the regimes involved have tried with differing success to slow or jam communication between groups on the inside and between demonstrators and those on the outside provides further evidence of the important role new social media have played.<strong>loc</strong> 329</li>
<li>On the other hand, revolts broke out in earlier epochs with a different mix of technologies available. Printing presses, for instance, often proved to be central to revolt coordination in the past, which was why regimes often sought to limit their number and control their output. And of course media employed to support uprisings can also be used to combat them.<strong>loc</strong> 334</li>
<li>Thus it seems fair to suggest that various media have played an important but not absolutely crucial role in the uprisings. What is crucial is the experience of collective action that knows how to make use of the organizing aid different media offer.<strong>loc</strong> 337   <strong>Note:</strong> nice quote</li>
<li>Campaigns by organized labor in Egypt and Tunisia served as key precedents for the uprisings in those countries. Egyptian laborers in particular had more experience taking action against their regime than did workers in any of the other countries in the run-up to the revolts of 2011. Between 2004 and 2008 over 1.5 million Egyptian workers participated in almost two thousand strikes across the country. Some of the most militant strikers, centered in the textile industries of the Nile Delta, linked their immediate demands for increased pay and fair working conditions to the corruption and autocracy of the Mubarak regime. In Tunisia, organized labor had been relatively quiet since the 1983-1984 bread riots that had swept across North Africa. Struggles with the regime tended to happen in closed meetings among senior union leadership rather than on the street. But in 2008, the mining town of Redayef near the western city of Gafsa exploded with protests over nepotistic hiring practices at the state-owned phosphate company and the persistent poverty in the region. The unrest spread to nearby towns, incorporating other trade unionists, teachers, and the unemployed. Despite the state media blackout, news of the protests traveled across Tunisia, inspiring solidarity actions in larger cities.<strong>loc</strong> 339   <strong>Note:</strong> background</li>
<li>Egypt’s strike wave of 2004-2011 was enhanced by the protests of professional associations and new middle-class activist groups like Kifaya and April 6 who organized solidarity protests as well as rallies against state repression of journalists, the blockade of Gaza and the continuing use of emergency laws.<strong>loc</strong> 355</li>
<li>Prior to Qaddafi’s fall, it was nearly impossible to conduct in-depth research in Libya because of the severe restrictions imposed by the state on journalists and academics, both Libyan and foreign. It was possible to write about Libyan foreign relations or prominent government decisions, and several authors did so in the pages of Middle East Report. But they could not offer the kind of bottom-up views of politics, society, and culture that were available for other countries, and so we do not have them for this volume.<strong>loc</strong> 373</li>
<li>No matter how these societies eventually emerge from the process of national transformation, they present valuable lessons in how to resist tyranny while struggling for democratic change and equitable economic development.<strong>loc</strong> 387</li>
<li><p>TUNISIA<strong>loc</strong> 413</p>

<ul>
<li>Located far from the beaches and seaside tourist resorts, interior towns have missed out on the considerable sums invested in Tunisia’s most important industry. The uneven development of the last four decades has exacerbated historical tensions and disparities between urban and rural Tunisians. What investment was earmarked for rural projects-millions in loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, among other sources-ultimately profited the agrarian elites who formed the backbone of Tunisia’s post-colonial ruling class.<strong>loc</strong> 424</li>
<li>Following Tunisia’s independence from France in 1956, the government led by Habib Bourguiba and his Socialist Destourian Party embarked on an explicitly liberalizing project, rewriting the Tunisian constitution and legal code to regularize rights for women and minorities and expanding access to public education. Despite early reforms, Bourguiba’s rule became increasingly personalized over the subsequent thirty years as he managed political contestation and dissent through media censorship, legal maneuvers, and violent crackdowns on organized labor and Islamist political movements.<strong>loc</strong> 428</li>
<li>In 1987, thirteen years after Bourguiba declared himself “president-for-life,” he was ousted from power by Ben Ali (then prime minister) who had the aging president declared mentally and physically unfit.<strong>loc</strong> 432</li>
<li>The neoliberal economic reforms that had begun, slowly, under Bourguiba accelerated as Ben Ali and his extended family became the prime beneficiaries of privatization and the development of new export industries.<strong>loc</strong> 434</li>
<li>Organized labor had a variable relationship with the regime, but mostly refrained from street politics in favor of high-level bargaining with the regime on bread-and-butter issues.<strong>loc</strong> 437</li>
<li>The police state also expanded dramatically under Ben Ali until over 1 percent of the population was employed by various policing and intelligence agencies. The police mediated daily life in Tunisia: They were the conduit for interacting with much of the state bureaucracy, as well as the regime’s primary surveillance mechanism.<strong>loc</strong> 440</li>
<li>State Security branch, which was responsible for monitoring, arresting and torturing dissidents.<strong>loc</strong> 443</li>
<li>Since Bourguiba’s presidency, the most potent threat to the regime-whose secularism was both ideological and a method of political control-came from the Islamist party al-Nahda. Both Bourguiba and Ben Ali arrested, exiled or killed most of al-Nahda’s cadres by the early 1990s but continued to use the threat of political Islam to justify authoritarian rule to international partners.<strong>loc</strong> 444</li>
<li>Ben Ali and Bourguiba also shared a mistrust of the armed forces as a potential threat to their rule. Rather than coopt the officer corps (as was the case with neighboring regimes), both men marginalized the military, keeping it underfunded and understaffed compared to the civil police.<strong>loc</strong> 447   <strong>Note:</strong> police v military</li>
<li>In the early weeks of 1984, the end of state subsidies of food staples caused widespread anti-government riots.<strong>loc</strong> 450</li>
<li>In 2008, mine workers in western Tunisia went on strike and took control of several towns, weathering government attacks for over six months before finally being crushed by the military. The regime claimed that Islamist terrorists were behind the unrest, but internet-savvy activists around the country publicized the workers’ grievances against government corruption and organized solidarity demonstrations in several other cities.<strong>loc</strong> 453</li>
<li>Widespread dissatisfaction with the government’s corruption-and the spectacular greed of the Ben Ali family-is part of what tipped the balance against the regime when protests erupted in 2010. Over twenty-three years, Ben Ali whittled away at the regime’s political base among elites by directing more and more of the state’s largesse into his own coffers.<strong>loc</strong> 456</li>
<li>Unemployment remains one of the most pressing challenges facing the new coalition government led by the revived al-Nahda.<strong>loc</strong> 460</li>
<li>the path of constitutional reform before permanent elections has allowed Tunisians a level of democratic control over the political transition absent in Egypt and Yemen. Two peaceful uprisings in 2011-the first to remove Ben Ali, and the second to abolish the system that backed him—and the continuing political ferment have inaugurated a new era of participatory politics in Tunisia.<strong>loc</strong> 464</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>TUNISIA’S WALL HAS FALLEN NADIA MARZOUKI<strong>loc</strong> 468</p>

<ul>
<li>The fast-paced and utterly unexpected fall of Tunisia’s dictator originated in what at first looked like a jacquerie of hungry, disenfranchised youths. Quickly, however, and spontaneously, the protests became overtly political as well as economic.<strong>loc</strong> 488</li>
<li>“Bread, water, yes; Ben Ali, no,” the crowds chanted.<strong>loc</strong> 497</li>
<li>top. On the morning of January 15, the Constitutional Court, Tunisia’s highest authority on such matters, declared that “the post of president is definitively vacant,” leading Ghannouchi to give way to Fouad Mebazaa, the parliamentary speaker, who promised to hold elections within the constitutionally prescribed period of forty-five to sixty days. The opposition forces vociferously objected, and successfully lobbied to delay the elections for eight months to allow more time for logistical arrangements and campaigning.<strong>loc</strong> 506</li>
<li>they represented the logical consequence of an unsustainable formula for fake political and economic stability, the very formula that many Western policymakers lauded as the “Tunisian miracle.”<strong>loc</strong> 510</li>
<li>Bouazizi (who later died of his burn wounds) was only the trigger rather than the cause of the protests, whose roots were much deeper and older.<strong>loc</strong> 512</li>
<li>In 2008, for example, the World Bank called Tunisia a “top regional reformer” in the domain of easing access to cr and the Bank’s country profile marveled that the Merranean nation had doubled its exports of goods and services over the preceding decade. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, president of the IMF, stated in November 2008 that the “Tunisian economy is going well” and that Tunisia is a “good example for emerging countries.”<strong>loc</strong> 520</li>
<li>political activists were subject to severe repression and intimidation at the hands of the police. Tunisia was among the most heavily policed states in the world, with over one hundred thousand policemen in uniform in a country of 10.4 million.<strong>loc</strong> 530</li>
<li>the president’s party established a very complex and pervasive regime of monitoring of ordinary citizens, described by the French political economist Béatrice Hibou as a “control grid” (dispositif de quadrillage).<strong>loc</strong> 533</li>
<li>due to the intrusive state measures, paranoia spread among the populace. After twenty-three years of internalizing fear, Tunisians became their own censors.<strong>loc</strong> 537</li>
<li>the longevity of the authoritarian system had come about through a combination of coercion and consent, what Hibou, in her book La Force de l’obéissance (2006), called a “security pact.” By the terms of this tacit deal, in exchange for relatively easy access to cr and consumer goods, the Tunisian people were expected to acquiesce to the lack of civil and political liberties.<strong>loc</strong> 539   <strong>Note:</strong> this sounds familiar</li>
<li>Tourism and call centers, where Tunisians record the orders of Western consumers, were two of the main exports in the World Bank’s accounting.<strong>loc</strong> 545</li>
<li>The corruption and bad governance of Ben Ali’s reign contributed to the increasing pauperization of this middle class and the dramatic rise of unemployment, especially among university graduates. Forty-six percent of youth with university degrees, like Bouazizi, had no jobs commensurate with their education.<strong>loc</strong> 548</li>
<li>Initially, commentators insisted as well that the demonstrations were disorganized, almost random, lacking in structure and direction. Most important, the movement was alleged to be unsustainable: In the absence of leadership from formal opposition forces, many analysts argued that it could not succeed.<strong>loc</strong> 556</li>
<li>These observers were perhaps comparing the protests of 2010-2011 to the unrest in Tunisia’s western hinterlands in 2008.<strong>loc</strong> 565</li>
<li>the movement remained essentially about advocating the rights of mine workers of the Gafsa area. It did not translate into a wider mobilization demanding the comprehensive rights of the Tunisian people.<strong>loc</strong> 571</li>
<li>The events of December and January were propelled by an organic convergence of various currents of discontent. Successively joining the unemployed graduates who started the movement were students, lawyers, bloggers, artists, hackers, housewives, children, doctors, professors, and shopkeepers-each group harboring specific grievances and using its own symbolic vocabulary, but all united in overall purpose.<strong>loc</strong> 574</li>
<li>the reigning clans of Tunisia got so greedy that they lost their ability to redistribute even a small portion of the booty among the upper reaches of society. They neglected to keep the complicity of the bourgeoisie in place.<strong>loc</strong> 583</li>
<li>Beyond the cross-class dimension, four aspects of the popular uprising were particularly critical.<strong>loc</strong> 584</li>
<li>The state-run media was, of course, a fount of disinformation, and the regime exerted great effort to muzzle other media and prevent citizens from learning the details of what was happening.<strong>loc</strong> 586</li>
<li>Police intimidation of journalists and warnings to foreigners to stay indoors were largely effective on this occasion, as well, in keeping the foreign media mute. The major exception was the Qatar-based satellite channel Al Jazeera,<strong>loc</strong> 588</li>
<li>The Tunisian events were not simply another illustration of the mighty “Al Jazeera effect,” though, since much of what this and other channels broadcast was made possible by a unique collaboration with Tunisians.<strong>loc</strong> 591</li>
<li>In December and January, more to the point, Tunisian youth managed to share critical information with each other, including live audio and video, about the exact unfolding of events.<strong>loc</strong> 595</li>
<li>Using such Web 2.0 platforms as nawaat.org and other social media, the movement broadcast its own news of kidnappings of protesters and its own summaries of the analyses of international observers, as well as the time and location of upcoming demonstrations.<strong>loc</strong> 596</li>
<li>The Tunisian events have accordingly been dubbed the first “Twitter revolution.” In his last speech, delivered on January 13, Ben Ali offered to stop censoring YouTube and other Internet outlets, provoking a swift and dismissive response. The majority answer on Twitter and other social media platforms could be summarized as follows: “We don’t want free YouTube or virtual democracy. We want a true regime change, conditioned upon the departure and eventual trial of Ben Ali, and the organization of free elections.”<strong>loc</strong> 600</li>
<li>Ben Ali appeared to believe that the protesters’ demands were about means of communication, rather than politics and justice.<strong>loc</strong> 604   <strong>Note:</strong> failure to understand the people</li>
<li>The intense public debates that characterized the month of protests did not take place solely on the Internet, however. They primarily occurred in the streets, which were transformed into a sort of large coffeehouse where excitement at the recovered freedom of speech coexisted with fear under the threat of state violence.<strong>loc</strong> 605</li>
<li>in addition to, and taking precedence over, the brutality, a remarkable sense of happiness, loquacity, and humor filled the streets of cities like Tunis, Gafsa, Sousse, and Sidi Bouzid.<strong>loc</strong> 608</li>
<li>Institutions that had been de facto instruments of the regime adapted to this awakening of civil society in very short order.<strong>loc</strong> 611</li>
<li>The sense of collective delight that emerged from this recovered right to speak was a challenge to the widespread notion that the “Arab street” is a space of little but anomie and diffuse anger.<strong>loc</strong> 613</li>
<li>Along with his fellow dictators, Ben Ali had long gulled his backers in the West with the idea that if the “Arab street” was ever opened, it would be filled with enraged Islamist men, calling for the imposition of shari‘a law and the intensification of gender inequality, if not also jihad. Yet at all the major demonstrations leading to Ben Ali’s flight from the country, men and women marched side by side, holding hands and chanting together in the name of civil rights, not Islam.<strong>loc</strong> 617</li>
<li>The tone of the protests was rather one of reappropriating patriotic language and symbols: Women and men lay in the streets to spell “freedom” or “stop the murders” with their bodies and worked together to tear down and burn the gigantic, Stalin-style portraits of Ben Ali on storefronts and street corners.<strong>loc</strong> 622</li>
<li>One of the most important elements of the uprising was the way in which “the people” (al-sha‘b al-tunisi) came to be the decisive category of identity in the country.<strong>loc</strong> 625</li>
<li>The slogan “The people want the fall of the regime” was, in part, a response to the misperception of Tunisians’ demands. The numerous demonstrators who brandished loaves of bread, chanting “Bread, yes-Ben Ali, no,” were objecting to analysis of their discontent in the Western press as purely economic, another “bread riot” to be quelled with minor subsidy adjustments. No, Tunisians argued, they represented not the hungry and downtrodden, but the entirety of the Tunisian people claiming their dignity. The emergence of the term sha‘b was part and parcel of this collective cri de coeur and thus of the success of the revolution.<strong>loc</strong> 626   <strong>Note:</strong> people&#39;s demandw</li>
<li>The normative dimension of the category of “the people” is novel in post-colonial Tunisia.<strong>loc</strong> 631</li>
<li>During the bread riots of 1983-1984, for example, the notion of sha‘b ironically appeared mainly in the patronizing rhetoric of the regime,<strong>loc</strong> 633</li>
<li>leader (za‘im)<strong>loc</strong> 639</li>
<li>While Bourguiba’s era saw significant achievements in literacy, public health, and women’s rights, the paternalistic relationship that developed between the za‘im and Tunisians left little room for participatory politics.<strong>loc</strong> 641</li>
<li>“The people” subsequently became the reference point that political projects had to adopt to be accepted as legitimate. This fact had the effect of making the projects more inclusive and, one may hope, broadening minds.<strong>loc</strong> 647</li>
<li>The concept of sha‘b seemed to compel Mourou to acknowledge pluralism.<strong>loc</strong> 653</li>
<li>The explosion in the number of political parties (more than seventy) was regarded as a sign of fragmentation, but the plurality of voices was evidence that the normative power of the category of people could not be coopted by an opportunistic new za‘im.<strong>loc</strong> 660</li>
<li>The elections of the constitutional assembly, on October 23, 2011, has led to an unprecedented coalition of secular and Islamist parties. While al-Nahda secured eighty-nine seats out of the 217 of the Assembly, the Congress for the Republic, a center-left party won 29 seats and Ettakatol, a center-right party, 19.<strong>loc</strong> 664</li>
<li>In terms of political symbolism, this revolution is the equivalent for the Arab world of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. It showed, if nothing else, that the region’s many dictators do not have to rule until they die, whether of natural or unnatural causes.<strong>loc</strong> 671</li>
<li>the Tunisian revolution has set a dramatic precedent for how democratization from below might begin.<strong>loc</strong> 673</li>

<li><p>TUNISIA’S POST-BEN ALI CHALLENGE: A PRIMER AMY AISEN KALLANDER<strong>loc</strong> 689</p>

<ul>
<li>Bourguiba controlled the judiciary, placed arbitrary limits on press freedoms and allocated such minimal prerogatives to legislative assemblies that there were few checks on his power.<strong>loc</strong> 709   <strong>Note:</strong> watch for signs</li>
<li>Bourguiba’s domestic practices were rarely questioned by his Cold War allies, who accepted his self-presentation as modern, Westernized, and democratic.<strong>loc</strong> 721</li>
<li>State propaganda subsequently glorified the coup as “the change.”<strong>loc</strong> 725</li>
<li>the commission drafting the electoral lists was appointed by the RCD, which also ran the polling stations and counted the ballots behind closed doors.<strong>loc</strong> 735</li>
<li>both the transitional government and the al-Nahda-CFR coalition have sought to impose limitations on public demonstrations and periodically censored the internet.<strong>loc</strong> 740</li>
<li>Newspapers were owned by members of the “First Family” and were self-censoring, while foreign dailies that were at all critical of the regime did not arrive at kiosks.<strong>loc</strong> 768</li>
<li>The government, of course, wrote the content of most radio and television broadcasts, and even attempted to limit the programming accessible on satellite television.<strong>loc</strong> 770</li>
<li>Tunisian dissidents increasingly turned to the Internet, but there a similar scenario applied, with the unique server in the country controlled by the government.<strong>loc</strong> 772</li>
<li>Cited as one of twelve countries in the category of “Internet Enemies” by Reporters Without Borders, Tunisia was also ranked third on a Forbes magazine list of “the world’s most Net-repressive regimes.” The government regularly blocked access to the webpages of opposition groups, exiled dissidents, and human rights organizations, as well as a number of blogs, YouTube, and DailyMotion. Applying sophisticated software, the regime presented a user trying to view those sites with a standard “404 Error” message on the screen.<strong>loc</strong> 781   <strong>Note:</strong> the 404</li>
<li>the government adopted the tactic of “phishing,” sending out fake e-mail messages designed to harvest the passwords for the Facebook pages and blogs of activists and then deleting the content.<strong>loc</strong> 785</li>
<li>Tunisians continued to be skeptical of official media and the misinformation campaigns sponsored by the interim government. As for Internet censorship, Amamou tweeted from a meeting with the ministers of interior and communications that it may be harder to undo than he had imagined, since technicians who answered to Ben Ali personally had access to the infrastructure of the Internet.<strong>loc</strong> 801</li>
<li>Human Rights Watch wrote in its 2007 country report, “The government uses the threat of terrorism and religious extremism as a pretext to crack down on peaceful dissent.” With the assistance of the Pentagon, which provides training to Tunisian forces, the regime arrested hundreds of youths on suspicion of involvement in terrorism, only rarely charging them with specific crimes.<strong>loc</strong> 830</li>
<li>It was thus sadly predictable that when Mohamed Bouazizi’s dramatic suicide sparked a series of demonstrations, Ben Ali claimed it was all the work of terrorists and radical Islamists. Though al-Nahda is now the largest bloc in the coalition government, the war on terrorism remains a key US interest in North Africa, the Saharan front in particular, and thus holds out the promise of continued aid flows. A small but active Salafi minority, and bands of hooligans, have ensured that Tunisia’s secular middle class can continue to wave the specter of a feared radical Islamist takeover, polarizing public debate, and perpetuating the simplistic binaries of the Ben Ali era.<strong>loc</strong> 839</li>
<li>In 2002, one human rights association estimated that the number of police officers was around 130,000, in a country with a population of 10.4 million.<strong>loc</strong> 846</li>
<li>Since job creation was not keeping up with unemployment, Ben Ali opened the ranks of the police to most anyone who came calling.<strong>loc</strong> 848</li>
<li>The working-class basis of at least certain sectors of the police force is evidenced by their joining in protests against the interim government on January 22 and by their demands to be unionized.<strong>loc</strong> 852</li>
<li>Ben Ali’s reliance on the police to control other Tunisians persisted to the detriment of investment in the military, the classic guarantor of regime stability in the Arab world. The army’s role in the December-January unrest that led to Ben Ali’s ouster is the subject of intense interest and contradictory information. Though the reasons why the army was deployed but did not shoot remain unclear, there were signs that the army had long been hostile toward the president.<strong>loc</strong> 853</li>
<li>In the absence of a police force that truly existed to serve and protect, ordinary citizens formed local community patrols to watch over their neighborhoods.<strong>loc</strong> 861</li>

<li><p>AUTHORITARIANISM AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN TUNISIA CHRISTOPHER ALEXANDER<strong>loc</strong> 878</p>

<ul>
<li>state and society in Tunisia had developed what the historian Mohamed Hedi Cherif describes as a unique form of “self-regulation.” During periods of economic or political crisis, Tunisians accepted a strong state that intervenes to restore order and prosperity. But that state also generated countervailing social forces that kept it in check when it became too powerful.1 Against this backdrop, the prospects for political reform under Ben Ali seemed good. If the president balked at his democratic promises, Tunisia possessed the kind of muscular civil society that would force him to follow through.<strong>loc</strong> 893</li>
<li>fade. Ben Ali refused to legalize al-Nahda, the country’s largest Islamist organization even though the party pledged to accept the rules of competitive democracy. And despite opposition demands for proportional legislative elections, the 1989 electoral code maintained the old majority list system. Those rules, combined with restrictions on media access and other interferences, allowed Ben Ali’s RCD to win every seat in the April 1989 elections.<strong>loc</strong> 903</li>
<li>Late-night raids and house-to-house searchers became commonplace in some neighborhoods. Stories of torture under interrogation and military court convictions multiplied.<strong>loc</strong> 909</li>
<li>Most Tunisians tolerated the government’s repression. As the press never ceased to remind them, a vigorous economy that could generate new jobs depended on Tunisia’s ability to attract foreign investment in a competitive regional environment. Ben Ali and other officials pointed to Algeria and Egypt and argued that tolerating any kind of Islamist party would lead only to economic chaos.<strong>loc</strong> 914   <strong>Note:</strong> tolerating repression in exchange for safety from terrorism and chaos</li>
<li>By his fifth anniversary in power, Ben Ali could legitimately claim to have saved Tunisia from economic bankruptcy and civil war.<strong>loc</strong> 922</li>
<li>Many opposition figures had held their fire during economic and political crisis. Once those crises passed, they called on the government to make good on its earlier promises. This pressure did move Ben Ali and the National Assembly to pass a new electoral law in December 1992, but it only allowed the legal opposition parties a pitifully small share of seats. At the same time, however, Ben Ali stepped up his campaign to quash any form of opposition.<strong>loc</strong> 923</li>
<li>Between 1987 and 1997, Ben Ali dramatically expanded Tunisia’s internal security apparatus. Critics claimed that much of this growth took place outside of the Interior Ministry and other official police forces. They argued that Ben Ali used a slush fund, labeled the “sovereignty fund” in the budget, to build up a parallel security apparatus run directly from the presidential palace.<strong>loc</strong> 928</li>
<li>surveillance and phone tapping to fabricated videocassettes, threats against family members, passport confiscations, beatings, and even assassinations.<strong>loc</strong> 932</li>
<li>Although Islamists were the regime’s single greatest preoccupation, it is misleading to reduce Tunisian politics under Ben Ali to a simple state versus Islamist dynamic.<strong>loc</strong> 943</li>
<li>As Tunisia’s first president, Bourguiba consolidated control over the party and state bureaucracies by coopting and manipulating clientele networks in ways that would concentrate power in his own hands without alienating his bases of support. Rather than becoming Tunisia’s sole political patron, he set out to become its chief patron.<strong>loc</strong> 949</li>
<li>Bourguiba established himself as the maker and breaker of political careers. He created tangible incentives for loyalty that consolidated his personal power much more effectively than a system based solely on repression and fear.<strong>loc</strong> 953</li>
<li>In the 1950s and again in the mid-1980s, Bourguiba discreetly supported worker unrest designed to undermine the union leadership. On both occasions he supported breakaway unions, and then reunited the labor movement under leaders who owed their positions to Bourguiba rather than to the rank and file.<strong>loc</strong> 956</li>
<li>Party elites also quietly encouraged unrest as a way of discring competitors, then tried to negotiate alliances with the student and worker movements in order to secure a popular base for their own ambitions. Getting the militants to back off allowed politicians to demonstrate their ability to deliver social peace.<strong>loc</strong> 960   <strong>Note:</strong> Discr those in power to assume it oneself</li>
<li>At his direction, the National Assembly passed legislation that gave the president the power to select the prime minister and designated that person as the automatic successor if the president died or became incapacitated. By establishing his personal control over the succession, Bourguiba reinforced his power by creating what William Zartman aptly describes as “position politics.”5 Rather than building alliances against Bourguiba, party barons conspired against one another to earn his favor and a chance to become prime minister.<strong>loc</strong> 966</li>
<li>First, strong economic growth in the 1970s supported a succession of wage increases and an extensive system of consumer subsidies. Second, the worker and student unions’ reliance on public funds allowed Bourguiba to intervene in and manipulate their internal politics.<strong>loc</strong> 974</li>
<li>By the mid-1980s, these conditions no longer obtained. Economic deterioration eroded the government’s ability to buy social peace.<strong>loc</strong> 976</li>
<li>The Islamic Tendency Movement-al-Nahda’s precursor—stepped into the void created by the union repression and became the social force that politicians publicly reviled and privately courted.<strong>loc</strong> 978</li>
<li>the vibrancy of Tunisia’s civil society and its ability to generate pressure on the state in the 1970s and early 1980s did not reflect a deep-seated political culture. Rather, it was a product of pragmatic political choices. Bourguiba’s strategy for consolidating and holding power created new opportunities for protest, and workers, students, Islamists, and others tried to use them to their own advantage.<strong>loc</strong> 981</li>
<li>Prior to becoming interior minister in 1986, Ben Ali had spent his entire career in the military and security forces. When he seized power, he stepped into the void at the center of a paralyzed political system. The deepening economic and political crisis had discred the ruling party’s traditional elite. Internal divisions and government repression had crippled the opposition parties and other organizations.<strong>loc</strong> 986</li>
<li>Battling al-Nahda was the government’s primary focus during the first ten years of Ben Ali’s rule. But this was precisely the kind of contest for which Ben Ali was eminently qualified.<strong>loc</strong> 993</li>
<li>From his perspective, then, a strike, a student demonstration, or an opposition communiqué could be much more than it appeared to be. Because any kind of contestation could be organized and manipulated by the opposition front it must be repressed.<strong>loc</strong> 1024</li>
<li>Beyond this climate of fear and intimidation, Ben Ali’s effort to break the connection between elite and popular politics also created a profound strategic malaise for the organizations that long constituted the bedrock of associational life.<strong>loc</strong> 1027</li>
<li>The dissolution of these ties, the end of position politics as it operated for so long, left Tunisia’s traditionally vigorous civil society adrift.<strong>loc</strong> 1033</li>
<li>But the remaining years of Ben Ali’s rule continued the schizophrenic combination of reform and repression that marked the first ten years. Ben Ali continued to repress criticism and contestation that he did not orchestrate.<strong>loc</strong> 1037</li>

<ul>
<li>In Tunisia, however, the World Bank supported projects that concentrated land holdings and favored large landowners. Neoliberal reforms, in general, rendered Tunisia’s peasantry less secure and more impoverished.<strong>loc</strong> 1066   <strong>Note:</strong> Role of world bank</li>
<li>Yet several factors contribute to growing inequalities within rural areas during agricultural economic liberalization.<strong>loc</strong> 1070</li>
<li>Taken together, in many countries, these factors culminate in policies that favor rural elites, increase rural asset disparities, and make no serious efforts to alleviate rural poverty.<strong>loc</strong> 1075</li>
<li>from its start in 1986, the World Bank’s agriculture lending in Tunisia favored the agrarian upper class.<strong>loc</strong> 1109</li>
<li>The World Bank’s agricultural sector loan supported privatizing agricultural cooperatives under the rubric of improving the management of natural resources.<strong>loc</strong> 1117</li>
<li>transferred to large landholders between 1986 and 1996. Despite projections (and hope) of new employment opportunities on these privatized farms, there was no net job creation in agriculture under Tunisia’s structural adjustment program.<strong>loc</strong> 1127</li>
<li>Estate owners also benefited from below-market input prices as well as cr and technological support from the state while only modest-to-poor efforts to improve small farmers’ access to cr and inputs was undertaken.<strong>loc</strong> 1137</li>
<li>prune.12 In addition to selling state-owned land, the structural adjustment program called for the privatization of the rural commons.<strong>loc</strong> 1146</li>
<li>some of the theoretical justifications for the structural adjustment programs of the 1980s reverted to a “trickle-down” approach, arguing that any economic growth ultimately aided the rural poor. Some theorists went so far as to argue that there was little need for sensitivity to equity in adjustment policy. Since “almost everyone” in Africa “is poor on any objective basis…the fact that adjustment programs may not directly benefit the absolutely poorest should have far less policy and moral implications than if there were a bias in a rich country. If adjustment programs help a significant number of people…then inevitably a large number of the poor will be helped.<strong>loc</strong> 1163</li>
<li>The primary goal for the World Bank in Tunisia into the late 1990s was to ensure the privatization of public enterprises, most of which were located in urban areas.<strong>loc</strong> 1179</li>

<li><p>THE MAKING OF TUNISIA’S INTIFADA LARYSSA CHOMIAK AND JOHN P. ENTELIS<strong>loc</strong> 1228</p>

<ul>
<li>As the waves of protest inspired by Tunisia rolled across the Middle East and North Africa, analysts were puzzled by the mysterious timing, incredible speed, and cross-national snowballing of these uprisings or intifadas.<strong>loc</strong> 1230</li>
<li>In Tunisia, the nature of autocratic rule and its relationship to citizens created the environment in which challenges to regime incumbency would lead to protest, resistance or revolution. The deeper and more robust the authoritarian structure, and the fewer the opportunities for legal political opposition and participation, the more likely citizens are to rebel.<strong>loc</strong> 1235</li>
<li>One of the distinctive characteristics of Ben Ali’s Tunisia was the virtual absence of an effective social movement.<strong>loc</strong> 1241</li>
<li>Tunisia’s disenfranchised masses developed mechanisms for dodging the tentacles of the authoritarian state, including tax avoidance, illegal tapping of municipal water and electricity supplies, and illicit construction of houses. Within this atmosphere of circumvention, moments of contentious politics nonetheless occurred, eventually leading to the precipitous puncturing of Ben Ali’s system of control.<strong>loc</strong> 1245</li>
<li>Bouazizi’s plight, many believe, represented the frustration of thousands of Tunisia’s young lumpen-intelligentsia, often overeducated but underemployed, facing an uncertain economic future at a time of rapidly increasing food prices.<strong>loc</strong> 1251</li>
<li>documentation of police violence was disseminated via the Internet, including the social networking sites Vimeo, Facebook, and Twitter, while the pan-Arab satellite network Al Jazeera spearheaded in-depth television coverage of the disturbances.<strong>loc</strong> 1254</li>
<li>More social media challenges to the regime were unleashed, none more symptomatic of the character of the revolution-to-come than the song of the rapper El General, “Rais el Bled.”<strong>loc</strong> 1257</li>
<li>Ben Ali tried to appease the populace, paying a visit to Mohamed Bouazizi’s hospital room just before his death and delivering a series of three public addresses, each less combative in tone than the one before. He concluded with a pledge that he would not run in the 2014 presidential election and subsequently promised to reduce censorship, lifting restrictions on YouTube and DailyMotion on January 12.<strong>loc</strong> 1262</li>
<li>“Operation Tunisia” had already shut down Ben Ali’s presidential website, his Facebook page, the Tunisian stock market website and other government portals.<strong>loc</strong> 1265</li>
<li>the General Union of Tunisian Workers (UGTT) called for a strike and two million Tunisian Facebook users changed their profiles to read, “Ben Ali dégage!” Many furiously stated that over one hundred protesters should not have had to die for YouTube to be unblocked.<strong>loc</strong> 1266</li>
<li>Deepening repression—from arbitrary economic barriers to jailing, disappearances, and torture—achieved a widespread political inertia just short of absolute submission. Nonetheless, courageous Tunisians engaged in episodic contention, notably in the southwestern mining town of Gafsa close to the Algerian border. The year 2008 was an especially hot one in Gafsa and nearby Redayef, as street protests began in January and February against unfair hiring and labor conditions imposed by the state-run phosphate company.<strong>loc</strong> 1273   <strong>Note:</strong> gafsa</li>
<li>The weekly protests in Redayef were not reported in the state-controlled press, though opposition papers such as al-Mawqif, al-Muwatin, and al-Tariq al-Jadid gave full coverage to the events. The waves of protest also caught the attention of university students on campuses in Tunis, Sfax, and Sousse, as well as among the Tunisian diaspora in France and Montreal.<strong>loc</strong> 1280</li>
<li>A targeted demonstration against unfair hiring practices on the part of a local phosphate monopoly had expanded into a broad movement attracting local, national, and international adherents.<strong>loc</strong> 1285</li>
<li>Catalyzed by the use of excessive force, greater numbers of Tunisians engaged in peaceful anti-government protests.<strong>loc</strong> 1287</li>
<li>Internet activists in Tunis, Gafsa, and Sfax began spreading the mining towns’ story on Facebook, reacting to the virtual non-reporting in the Tunisian press and the blocking of all international news sites that covered the events.<strong>loc</strong> 1292</li>
<li>On August 18, Ben Ali ordered that Facebook be shut down, citing national security concerns.<strong>loc</strong> 1293</li>
<li>But the regime was compelled to unblock the social networking site less than a month later following an international pressure campaign on Facebook. By 2010-2011, activists in Tunisia were well schooled in Internet campaigns as well the Ben Ali regime’s responses to them.<strong>loc</strong> 1296</li>
<li>One of the last instances of contentious politics preceding the revolution was a protest organized by six young activists via Facebook and Twitter called Tunisie en Blanc (Tunisia in White) on May 22, 2010.<strong>loc</strong> 1299</li>

One of the organizers of the campaign was Slim Amamou, who has devoted years to fighting Internet censorship in Tunisia. His nickname “Slim 404” refers to the ubiquitous error message indicating that a site is blocked or censored.<strong>loc</strong> 1305</li>
<li>He was arrested on January 6, 2011 for dissident blogging, but then appointed minister of sports and youth after Ben Ali’s fall.<strong>loc</strong> 1309</li>
<li>The event, nonetheless, provided important training for future Internet campaigns and marked out a public forum for political debate.<strong>loc</strong> 1323</li>

<li><p>BEYOND GHANNOUCHI: ISLAMISM AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN TUNISIA RIKKE HOSTRUP HAUGBØLLE AND FRANCESCO CAVATORTA<strong>loc</strong> 1334</p>

<ul>
<li>On October 23, 2011, for the first time since independence in 1956, Tunisians were called to the polls in free and transparent elections. They were to choose 217 members of a Constituent Assembly that for a year would play a double role: drafting a new constitution and governing the country.<strong>loc</strong> 1336</li>
<li>al-Nahda ended up in a three-party coalition with the Congress for the Republic, led by Moncef Marzouki, a left-wing nationalist party that came in second with twenty-nine seats, and Ettakatol, a social democratic party that finished fourth with twenty seats and is helmed by Mostapha Ben Jaafar.<strong>loc</strong> 1346</li>
<li>On December 22, 2011 the new government was approved. The three-party agreement stipulated that Hamadi Jebali, secretary-general of al-Nahda, would be prime minister, Marzouki would be president and Ben Jaafar leader of the Assembly.<strong>loc</strong> 1350</li>
<li>the French semi-presidential system was clearly influential on the provisional institutions while the Constituent Assembly debates the form of government to be adopted for the future.<strong>loc</strong> 1357</li>
<li>Analyses of al-Nahda’s victory to date have missed the crucial element of long-term social change, in particular the unexpected return to religiosity by large sectors of Tunisian society since the 1990s.<strong>loc</strong> 1389</li>
<li>controlled. It was the bottom-up activism of ordinary citizens, much of it near spontaneous, that carried the party so far, so fast.<strong>loc</strong> 1393</li>
<li>January 2011, there were no offices, no public activities, no visible signs of al-Nahda…so the structure of the party today is a product of people’s engagement.<strong>loc</strong> 1396</li>
<li>al-Nahda is best understood as a broad movement with multiple constituencies that subscribe to an Islamic ideal that developed during Ben Ali’s rule, under the radar of the regime.<strong>loc</strong> 1399</li>
<li>More than twenty-five years have elapsed since al-Nahda’s last chance to operate openly—and the country has changed dramatically in that duration. Three phenomena are noteworthy in this respect: the emergence of a pro-market middle class at ease with much of Western modernity; the enunciation of a stronger Arab Muslim identity that deviates from the Western-inspired and particularly French-inspired project of modernization in post-independence Tunisia; and the parallel emphasis on Islam as personal piety.<strong>loc</strong> 1404</li>
<li>Privatization and the wider embrace of market economics were profitable for Ben Ali’s cronies from the beginning, and were implemented in part to strengthen authoritarian rule.2 But these policies also managed to achieve considerable economic growth, leading to improvements in education standards, health, and other indices of human development, particularly during the first decade of Ben Ali’s rule.<strong>loc</strong> 1409</li>
<li>Tunisia did emerge from Ben Ali’s reforms with a larger and newly entrepreneurial, globalized, and educated middle class. By the 2000s, however, the Tunisian economy had degenerated into a predatory system, with members of the presidential clan and close collaborators wielding both patronage and repression to acquire larger and larger slices of the pie.<strong>loc</strong> 1413</li>
<li>One response from the ranks of this middle class was fresh interest in Islamic values as a counter to the crass, corrupt, and soulless consumerism of their rulers.<strong>loc</strong> 1419</li>
<li>The regime’s suppression of a strong Arab Muslim identity from 1956 onward was carried out in the name of modernization, but Islam’s disappearance from public life did not mean that all Tunisians abandoned the faith as part of their identity.<strong>loc</strong> 1422</li>
<li>society. In the early 2000s, a religious reawakening began to offer a model of Arab Muslim identity that promoted values often associated with Western modernity, such as tolerance and self-improvement, and recast those values as forming the core of Islam.<strong>loc</strong> 1428</li>
<li>Tunisians also became more involved in social activism, which was perceived not only as a religious duty, but also as an ethical choice implicitly condemning the regime as unethical. This trend was strengthened by the spread of satellite dishes across Tunisia picking up speed around 2000 and the launch of Islamic satellite channels such as al-Majd and Iqra.<strong>loc</strong> 1436</li>
<li>Qur’an association called Riadh Ennasr, founded in 2007 in Cité An-Nasr, a middle-class suburb north of the capital of Tunis. The six co-founders, all men under forty, lived in Cité An-Nasr—an upper middle class area where many nouveaux riche moved to escape the increasing poverty of the capital4—but were alienated by what they felt was its hollow, consumerist culture.<strong>loc</strong> 1442</li>
<li>Implicit in the association was a critique of what seemed to be the dominant values in Tunisia, namely consumerism, corruption, and a more general loss of self. The founders felt that Tunisians could cultivate an identity of their own—one that combined the best of what they saw coming from the West and the best from Islam.<strong>loc</strong> 1449</li>
<li>All these sentiments are apolitical in isolation, but in the aggregate they highlight the yearning of many Tunisians to reconnect with an identity that they felt was being lost or misrepresented by the regime, particularly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when Ben Ali seemed eager to equate Islam with terrorism as a means of pleasing the West.<strong>loc</strong> 1466</li>
<li>But for the rise of private Islamic activism, it was the linkage between ethics and Islam that mattered; their welfare provision was a counter to the immorality of the regime, a view shared by activists in wealthy areas such as Cité An-Nasr and in much poorer districts and towns.<strong>loc</strong> 1491</li>
<li>While the number of Islamic associations has grown after the revolution, the phenomenon is not a function of the fall of Ben Ali. It is characterized by an Islam that is deeply personal, centered on social activism rather than politics and dependent on local networks for support and expansion. The glue of these networks is a specific understanding and practice of Islam whereby religious precepts apply to those who choose them and are not imposed on the whole of the community.<strong>loc</strong> 1493</li>
<li>the stated interest of al-Nahda coincides with that of many social activists, who simply want to be left alone by the state to pursue their task as they see fit. It is largely these younger middle-class activists, together with the older generation of militants returning from exile and coming out of prison, who have swollen the ranks of al-Nahda and contributed to its success.<strong>loc</strong> 1513</li>
<li>Young and old, the pious middle class rather supports the quest for a decentralized democracy with a thriving private sector. The new generation believes in free-market forces and wants to take advantage of the fall of the regime to expand the business opportunities they were denied under Ben Ali. (The anti-capitalist rhetoric for which al-Nahda was known in the 1980s has thus receded.)<strong>loc</strong> 1517</li>
<li>The other bond shared by old and new supporters is the attachment to religious values and practices that they believe should inform policymaking, but not dictate it. al-Nahda’s decision to exclude references to shari‘a in the new Constitution likely reflected this orientation, as well as the widely held belief that Tunisians must adopt shared rules as the country charts its democratic course.<strong>loc</strong> 1524</li>

<li><p>EGYPT<strong>loc</strong> 1544</p>

<ul>
<li>Though the fuse of Arab revolt may have been lit by the events in Tunisia, it was the fall of Mubarak that fanned the flame.<strong>loc</strong> 1547</li>
<li>Much of the groundwork for the Egyptian revolt was laid during the previous eight years of labor, student, and peasant strikes.<strong>loc</strong> 1549</li>
<li>a wave of strikes during the 2000s inaugurated a new era of militancy among Egyptian workers and professionals.<strong>loc</strong> 1550</li>
<li>The early 2000s also saw an increase in political demonstrations against the Mubarak regime’s relationship to Israel and the United States in response to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the physical re-occupation of the West Bank by the Israeli military, and Egypt’s participation in the blockade of Gaza.<strong>loc</strong> 1554</li>
<li>These issues united diverse coalitions of activists including students, professionals, labor, and Islamist groups. A mass protest held in Tahrir Square against the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a key precursor to the Square’s occupation in 2011.<strong>loc</strong> 1556</li>
<li>the Mubarak regime tolerated a high degree of public dissent compared to other authoritarian regimes in the region. Egypt enjoyed a surprising level of press freedom and general access to media. There was little internet censorship and independent journals, magazines and satellite stations proliferated, though certain red lines limiting criticism of the government were enforced. Protests were usually confined to private spaces like universities and mosques, but the regime also worked to manage public demonstrations that did not target Mubarak or the government in order to give such frustrations a controlled outlet.<strong>loc</strong> 1560</li>
<li>None of this relative openness negates the fact that Egypt was, and remains, a police state.<strong>loc</strong> 1564</li>
<li>Egypt’s military, though an important element of regime power, operated with a degree of independence from Mubarak and his National Democratic Party (NDP). Many military officers were local power brokers capable of waiving compulsory military service or easing interactions with the state for the right price.<strong>loc</strong> 1568</li>
<li>Civil society groups were heavily restricted by laws controlling their funding and the nature of their operations. Anti-terrorism laws gave cover to the regime’s attacks on Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brothers.<strong>loc</strong> 1572</li>
<li>Presidential elections in Egypt were one-candidate referendums until 2005.<strong>loc</strong> 1583</li>
<li>Gamal was integrated into the government and ruling party in various economic advisory roles, and was the public face of the regime’s campaign of privatization and economic restructuring. Public distrust of Gamal was thus not motivated only by fear that Egypt might become a jumlukiyya (republico-monarchy), like Syria under the Asads, but also of the continuing neoliberalization of the economy that had impoverished so many in the preceding two decades.<strong>loc</strong> 1586</li>
<li>Structural adjustment policies and privatization schemes begun under President Sadat and expanded under Mubarak left most Egyptians suffering from rising prices and stagnant or falling wages.<strong>loc</strong> 1590</li>
<li>Privatization of land for industrial agriculture and real estate development saw the consolidation of large tracts of land under wealthy families and corporations, both domestic and international.<strong>loc</strong> 1595</li>
<li>The military council that took power after Mubarak’s departure moved to insulate its authority from any elected government through unilaterally-applied constitutional amendments that weaken the presidency and give the military veto power over the new national charter.<strong>loc</strong> 1600</li>

<li><p>THE PRAXIS OF THE EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION MONA EL-GHOBASHY<strong>loc</strong> 1604</p>

<ul>
<li>“Our assessment is that the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people,” said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on January 25, 2011.<strong>loc</strong> 1607</li>
<li>Parties, elections, and civic associations were allowed but carefully controlled, providing space for just enough participatory politics to keep people busy without threatening regime dominance.<strong>loc</strong> 1611</li>
<li>The media was relatively free, giving vent to popular frustrations. And even the wave of protest that began to swell in 2000 was interpreted as another index of the regime’s skill in managing, rather than suppressing, dissent.<strong>loc</strong> 1614</li>
<li>Three main explanations emerged to make sense of this conundrum: technology, Tunisia, and tribulation.<strong>loc</strong> 1616</li>
<li>In the following days, every major news outlet framed the uprising as the work of wired, savvy twenty-somethings awakening the liberating potential of Facebook, Twitter, and the writings of American intellectual Gene Sharp. “For the world’s despots, his ideas can be fatal,” asserted the New York Times of Sharp.<strong>loc</strong> 1619</li>
<li>Esam Al-Amin notes that the Tunisian revolution “inspired Egyptians beyond the activists or elites.”<strong>loc</strong> 1623</li>
<li>A third theorem focused on the many tribulations afflicting Egyptians, particularly soaring commodity prices, positing that hardship finally pushed the population to rise up against oppression.<strong>loc</strong> 1624</li>
<li>One is the dramaturgical model, identifying a cast of self-propelled characters, armed with courage and a new consciousness, who then make an uprising. The second is the grievance model, by which an accumulation of social troubles steadily diffuses among the population and finally reaches an unforeseeable tipping point.<strong>loc</strong> 1629</li>
<li>aggrieved and heroic people exist under every type of political system, the models do not explain when such people will band together to challenge the conditions they deplore.<strong>loc</strong> 1632</li>
<li>What shifted the balance away from the regime were four continuous days of street fighting, January 25-28, that pitted the people against police all over the country. That battle converted a familiar, predictable episode into a revolutionary situation.<strong>loc</strong> 1635</li>
<li>By January 25, 2011, a strong regime faced a strong society versed in the politics of the street.<strong>loc</strong> 1640</li>
<li>Mubarak used the political arena to coopt critics and the coercive apparatus to deal with those who would not be incorporated.<strong>loc</strong> 1649</li>
<li>political scientist and Mubarak loyalist ‘Ali al-Din Hilal to a US diplomat, who in a 2009 cable reported that Hilal said, “Widespread, politically motivated unrest was unlikely because it was not part of the ‘Egyptian mentality.’”<strong>loc</strong> 1653</li>
<li>The reality was that Egyptians had been practicing collective action for at least a decade, acquiring organizational experience in that very old form of politics: the street action.<strong>loc</strong> 1657</li>
<li>To compel unresponsive officials to enact or revoke specific policies, citizens blockaded major roads with tree branches and burning tires; organized sit-ins in factory plants or outside ministry buildings; and blocked the motorcades of governors and ministers.<strong>loc</strong> 1659</li>
<li>2001, one of forty-nine protest events recorded that year by just one newspaper.<strong>loc</strong> 1661</li>
<li>By 2008, there were hundreds of such protests every year, big and small.<strong>loc</strong> 1664</li>
<li>households. Police used tear gas and batons to disperse demonstrators, and ninety people were arrested.8 If one classifies Egypt’s protests by the type of mobilizing structure that brings people out into the street, rather than the content of their claims, three sectors are salient, each with its own repertoire of tactics. The first is workplace protest, including collective action by industrial laborers, by civil servants, by students, and by trade practitioners such as auto mechanics and gold traders. The second is neighborhood protest, whether on the scale of a single street or an entire town. Protests by Copts, Sinai Bedouins, and farmers are often organized along residential lines. Associational protest is the third sector. The organizing mediums here are professional associations such as lawyers’ and doctors’ syndicates; social movements such as the pro-Palestine solidarity campaigns, the anti-Mubarak Kifaya movement, and the April 6 youth group; and the youth wings of political parties such as Ayman Nour’s liberal Ghad, the Muslim Brothers, the liberal-national Wafd, the Nasserist Karama, and the Islamist Wasat.<strong>loc</strong> 1666</li>
<li>Doing politics outdoors brought citizens face-to-face with the caste that rules the streets: Egypt’s ubiquitous police.<strong>loc</strong> 1675</li>
<li>It was a police state because the coercive apparatus had become the chief administrative arm of the state, aggregating the functions of several agencies. Police not only dealt with crime and issued passports, drivers’ licenses, and birth and death certificates. They also resolved local conflicts over land and sectarian relations; fixed all national and sub-national elections; vetted graduate school candidates and academic appointments at every level; monitored shop floors and mediated worker-management conflicts; observed soccer games and Friday prayers; and maintained a network of local informants in poor neighborhoods, to ensure that dispossession was not converted into political organization.<strong>loc</strong> 1676</li>
<li>Two signal events embedded these local patterns of friction into a national framework. In June 2010, a young Alexandrian named Khalid Sa’id was hauled out of his chair at an Internet café and beaten to death by plainclothes police officers on the street during an arrest for marijuana possession.<strong>loc</strong> 1698</li>
<li>The second occasion was the national legislative elections. Under complete police management, the elections in November-December 2010 were flagrantly rigged to return 97 percent of the seats for Mubarak’s vehicle, the National Democratic Party (NDP). The elections outraged political elites and ordinary people alike, spurring a unified opposition protest on December 12, and leaving behind fresh memories of street battles in dozens of districts across the country.<strong>loc</strong> 1703</li>
<li>By the time January 25, 2011 arrived, there was local resonance for the planned national “day of rage” in virtually every corner of Egypt.<strong>loc</strong> 1706</li>
<li>Unwittingly, the regime itself provided the calendar date for the “day of rage,” having newly designated January 25 a bank holiday to mark Police Day.<strong>loc</strong> 1710</li>
<li>Several get-out-the-protest clips on YouTube strung together notorious scenes of police brutality captured by cell phone video cameras. Members of all protest sectors announced their participation, including Mahalla workers, Sinai Bedouins, and civil servants employed by the cabinet. New actors joined in, such as hard-core fans of the two biggest national soccer teams and Khalid Sa‘id’s mother, who, in an interview uploaded by Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei’s reform campaign on January 21, also urged Egyptians to reclaim their rights in the streets.<strong>loc</strong> 1712</li>
<li>The January 25 protest started as a midsize demonstration and ended as a massive uprising against autocratic rule.<strong>loc</strong> 1730</li>
<li>demonstrations law of 1914 requiring a permit for any public gathering of more than five persons.<strong>loc</strong> 1738</li>
<li>Zero hour, as announced by protest organizers, was to be 2 pm. The stated plan was to demonstrate in front of the Interior Ministry and then disband at 5 pm. Security forces therefore sealed off all the vital downtown streets leading to and from the Ministry, allowing pedestrians to pass only after checking ID cards. But it was a ruse. On the morning of January 25, organizers used cell phones and landlines to disseminate the real locations of the protests and the actual start time: noon. “The protest locations announced on Facebook and to the press were the major landmarks. The idea was to start marching down small side streets and pick up people along the way, so that by the time demonstrators reached the announced locations, they would be large crowds that security couldn’t corral,” explained organizer al-‘Ulaymi.<strong>loc</strong> 1749</li>
<li>In the provinces, there were also large demonstrations. Police containment varied in intensity, with some brigades tolerating the columns of protesters and others losing control of the crowds, as in Cairo.<strong>loc</strong> 1782</li>
<li>The thousands of demonstrators who had been wending their way through different parts of the city were streaming through all the approaches to the square.<strong>loc</strong> 1800</li>
<li>When hotheads in the crowd started hurling rocks at riot police, a chant rose up from both the front lines and cheerleaders on the sidelines, “No stones! No stones!” In this army, the commanders and the foot soldiers were one.<strong>loc</strong> 1812</li>
<li>Volunteers ranged across the square, collecting garbage in plastic bags. People built fires and danced around their light. Out of nowhere, food and blankets appeared, to the delighted claps and cries of the encampment.<strong>loc</strong> 1817</li>
<li>As they had repeated over and over again throughout the day, they wanted: “Bread, freedom, social justice!” After sunset, as demonstrators realized their own power, this troika began to alternate with the Tunisian anthem: “The people want to overthrow the regime!”<strong>loc</strong> 1822</li>
<li>The riot police lieutenant colonel received the order at midnight. “The square had to be cleaned up,” he recounted. “Absolutely no one was to spend the night there.” The armored vehicles closed in, the riot troops were arrayed and the first tear gas canister was lobbed into the sit-in at 12:45 am.<strong>loc</strong> 1827</li>
<li>the synchronized diffusion of protests across the country, the fluidity of crowd movement in the two major cities and citizens’ euphoric sense of the weak points of the police. As the operations room lieutenant colonel recalled, “What we saw on January 25 was an uprising, not a demonstration. A young man standing in front of an armored vehicle, jumping on it to strike it, falling off and then doing it again? Honestly, there was no fear.”<strong>loc</strong> 1837</li>
<li>For a capable autocrat like Mubarak, large protests are no cause for anxiety. The fears are diffusion and linkage. Indeed, the diffusion of collective action in time and space emboldened Egyptians, signaling the unwillingness or incapacity of the coercive apparatus to suppress demonstrations. The simultaneity of protests across very different locations, especially the filling of streets in neighborhoods entirely unused to such processions, revised citizens’ calculations of what was possible and reduced uncertainty about the consequences of action. The second fear is the coordination between the three organizational infrastructures of protest. Indeed, the state security directorate existed to frustrate precisely this bridge building. It had done so quite successfully with the April 6, 2008 general strike, and had a stellar track record in branding each sector of dissent with a different label: Associational protest was “political,” but workplace and neighborhood protest was “economic.”<strong>loc</strong> 1855</li>
<li>The diffusion of protests on January 25–27 shattered both the mental and material divisions between Egypt’s three protest sectors, forcing the regime to confront them simultaneously, when for thirty years it had done so serially.<strong>loc</strong> 1862    - Note: power of unity</li>
<li>Percolating up from these varied locales was a decision to hold another round of protest on the next common-sense date: after Friday prayers on January 28, first dubbed “the Friday of the martyrs and the detained.”<strong>loc</strong> 1874</li>
<li>On the evening of January 27, police and protesters each held planning meetings to plot the second act of the confrontation. Police officials devised a comprehensive scheme to cut off physical and virtual means of linkage. They ordered a shutdown of Internet and cellular phone service for the next day; cell phones were especially important for demonstrators to spread news of protest diffusion in real time, and to share spot instructions or eleventh-hour location changes.<strong>loc</strong> 1886</li>
<li>the youth groups and opposition forces coordinating the protest added new locations and reacquainted themselves with landlines to cope with the cellular shutdown. Opposition parties who had sat out the January 25 action—the Tagammu‘ leftists and the Nasserists—scrambled to join up. And the Muslim Brothers threw their organizational weight behind the Friday gathering, revising their calculus of risk after seeing the momentous events of the previous three days. The players readied themselves, and the world watched.<strong>loc</strong> 1893</li>
<li>When the crowds reached town and city centers, they encircled police stations, provincial government buildings, and NDP headquarters, the triad of institutions emblematic of the regime. The syncopated chorus that had traveled from Sidi Bouzid to Tunis now shook the Egyptian earth: “The people…want…to overthrow the regime!”<strong>loc</strong> 1900</li>
<li>chant outside the NDP headquarters: “Corruption caused this country’s destruction!”<strong>loc</strong> 1906</li>
<li>Everywhere, the rising of the commons was met with superior force. Police fired tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, and—the ultimate escalation—live ammunition. The goal, to be reached at any cost, was to prevent separate crowds of demonstrators from fusing together in city centers. State security commandeered ambulances to arrest the unsuspecting injured, and hospitals were pressured into falsifying the cause of death for demonstrators who were shot at close range.<strong>loc</strong> 1907</li>
<li>In five compact hours, from noon to 5 pm, the police battled the people in all areas of the capital, desperate to thwart the amalgamation of multitudes in Tahrir Square. A climactic battle erupted on the Qasr al-Nil bridge, as surging crowds from the west sought to cross the river to join their brethren converging on Tahrir from the east. Qasr al-Nil has rightly been memorialized in word and video.<strong>loc</strong> 1932</li>
<li>The people’s insistent anthem, as outside Parliament on January 25, was “Silmiyya! Silmiyya!” and “No stones! No stones!” When police used overwhelming force, including live rounds, the people switched tactics, forming a barricade with overturned dumpsters, seizing the shields of riot police, and burning the vehicles and the police station.<strong>loc</strong> 1938</li>
<li>The Egyptian uprising telescoped the daily encounters between people and police that had played out for more than ten years. Al-‘Adli’s police force did not melt away in the face of a popular onslaught. It fought for four straight days on nearly every street corner in every major city, before finally being rendered inefficient by the dynamism and stamina of exceptionally diverse crowds, each with their own know-how in the art of interfacing with gendarmes.<strong>loc</strong> 1943    Note: people vs. police</li>
<li>At 5 pm on the afternoon of January 28, when reports started rolling in of police stations burning down, one after another, al-‘Adli capitulated and ordered the removal of his forces from the streets. It was a sight unseen in modern Egyptian police rule—the one and only time that Egypt’s three protest subcultures were able to jointly defeat the coercive apparatus that had existed to keep them apart.<strong>loc</strong> 1947</li>
<li>tank. In a six-hour interrogation by the prosecution, on charges of responsibility for the deaths and injuries, al-‘Adli shunted blame upward and downward. He accused his four top assistants of providing him with false intelligence, and demanded that Husni Mubarak be held accountable for the decision to fire on demonstrators, in his capacity as head of the Supreme Police Council. But he did concede defeat.   The situation was beyond imagination. The faces of the demonstrators showed how clear they were in challenging the regime and how much they hated it, how willing they were to resist with their bodies all attempts to divide them with truncheons and water cannons and all other tools. They outnumbered security forces by a million or more, a fact that shocked the Interior Ministry leaders and the president. Those government officials all sat at home watching the demonstrations on TV. Not one of them devised a political solution to what policemen were facing—confrontations with angry people and indescribable hatred of the government. All of us were astonished.<strong>loc</strong> 1952</li>
<li>The lieutenants’ acquittal on these charges in June 2012 sparked a revival of mass demonstrations around the country and a reoccupation of Tahrir Square.<strong>loc</strong> 1963</li>
<li>When Husni Mubarak appeared shortly after midnight on January 29 to announce his appointment of a new government, it was the first time in his tenure that he had been summoned to the podium by popular fiat.<strong>loc</strong> 1966</li>
<li>Since Mubarak had made it impossible to remove him from office through elections, Egyptians resorted to the streets to relay the people’s choice.<strong>loc</strong> 1970     Note: interesting point!</li>
<li>With remarkable focus, citizens targeted the structures of rule that had disenfranchised and dispossessed them for decades. The police stations and NDP headquarters were the first targets, but the nascent revolutionaries did not stop there, hitting municipal councils, governors’ offices, state security buildings, police checkpoints, traffic departments, toll booths, utility buildings, and other institutions that had taken their resources without giving in return.<strong>loc</strong> 1974</li>
<li>The genius of the Egyptian revolution was its methodical restoration of the public weal. The uprising restored the meaning of politics, if by that term is understood the making of collective claims on government. It revalued the people, revealing them in all their complexity-neither heroes nor saints, but citizens.<strong>loc</strong> 1981</li>
<li>Mubarak’s hereditary succession project being the revolution’s very first casualty. It compelled the police to bring back their old motto, erasing al-‘Adli’s sinister “police and people in service to the nation” and returning “the police at the service of the people.” The countless public institutions branded with the names of Mubarak and his wife are now being rechristened in the names of regular people who died for the revolution.<strong>loc</strong> 1984</li>

<li><p>WORLDS APART: AN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE AND THE INTERNATIONAL TOURISM INDUSTRY TIMOTHY MITCHELL<strong>loc</strong> 2055</p>

<ul>
<li>Life was a meal you never got to eat.<strong>loc</strong> 2064</li>
<li>The World Bank’s program for Luxor tourism was designed to increase this separation. The Bank’s consultants conducted a survey in Luxor and reported that tourists’ biggest complaint was of being bothered continually by locals trying to take them somewhere or sell them something. The consultants recommended that no further peddler licenses be issued, and devised a visitor management scheme to minimize unregulated contact between tourists and the local community. Separate ferry and bus facilities were to be improved to isolate the movement of tourists from local traffic. An enclosed visitor center would have its own restaurant and shops. In Ayman’s village, plans called for an elevated walkway through the middle of the village so that tourists could cross from the bus park to the Pharaonic temple without setting foot in the village itself. This kind of enclave tourism arrangement became typical of tourist development in the Third World, required by the increasing disparity between the wealth of tourists and the poverty of the countries they visit.<strong>loc</strong> 2110     Note: disparity</li>
<li>Except for a small and wealthy elite, the local population is excluded from these enclaves, kept out by the prices and the guards posted at the gate. The result is almost total segregation.<strong>loc</strong> 2129</li>
<li>In the 1980s the Bank directed Egyptian public funds into building the infrastructure for tourist development, with projects like the one in Luxor. In the 1990s the Bank began pushing for the profits from this public investment to be switched into private, and especially foreign, hands.<strong>loc</strong> 2135</li>
<li>Increased control by international capital sent not just the profits abroad, but tourist expenditure in general. Increasing international integration of the tourist industry decreases the proportion of tourist expenditure that remains in the host country.<strong>loc</strong> 2148</li>
<li>In the 1982 World Bank survey, alongside the complaint about the behavior of peddlers and local merchants, the most frequent tourist request was for more meaningful contact with the local population.<strong>loc</strong> 2176</li>

<li><p>STRIKES IN EGYPT SPREAD FROM CENTER OF GRAVITY JOEL BEININ AND HOSSAM EL-HAMALAWY<strong>loc</strong> 2255</p>

<ul>
<li>In the last decade of President Husni Mubarak’s rule, the longest and strongest wave of worker protest since the 1940s rolled through Egypt. In March of 2007, the liberal daily al-Misri al-Yawm estimated that no fewer than 222 sit-in strikes, work stoppages, hunger strikes, and demonstrations had occurred during 2006. In the first five months of 2007, the paper reported a new labor action nearly every day. The citizen group Egyptian Workers and Trade Union Watch documented fifty-six incidents during the month of April, and another fifteen during the first week of May alone.1<strong>loc</strong> 2257</li>
<li>Like almost all strikes in Egypt in the preceding forty years, these work stoppages were “illegal”—unauthorized by the state-sponsored Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF) and its subsidiary bodies in factories and other workplaces. But unlike upsurges of working-class collective action in the 1980s and 1990s, which were confined to state-owned industries, the wave that began in late 2004 also pushed along employees in the private sector.<strong>loc</strong> 2263</li>
<li>These workers were protesting the sale of their enterprise without a commitment from the prospective new owner, the private sector bank al-Masraf al-Muttahid, to pay supplemental wages and profit shares due them since 1995.<strong>loc</strong> 2273</li>
<li>On March 24, 2007, and again on April 2, nearly half of the firm’s twelve thousand workers struck to protest discrimination between workers and managers in the allocation of shares when the company was sold, failure to pay workers dividends on their shares, and the elimination of paid sick leave and a paid weekend. Workers last received dividends on their shares in 1997, when they were paid 60 Egyptian pounds (about $10.45 at the time).<strong>loc</strong> 2276</li>
<li>“The authorities are clamping down on the center now because they don’t know how to deal with the waves of strikes that have rocked the country over the past six months. They need a scapegoat, so they are accusing us of inciting the workers to strike. But how can they accuse us of inciting all 220 of the strikes estimated to have occurred in 2006?”7 The closure of CTUWS was the climax to a month of escalating aggressiveness by security forces in attempting to break up strikes and other forms of collective action.<strong>loc</strong> 2352</li>
<li>government mouthpieces claimed that the Mahalla workers were “incited” to action by the Muslim Brothers and other opposition political parties.<strong>loc</strong> 2397</li>
<li>Indeed, the workers did not have a unified political position.<strong>loc</strong> 2401</li>
<li>Twenty-three year old worker Karim al-Buhayri, who writes a widely read Arabic blog called Egyworkers, said, “Find us another society to live in. Or find us other rulers to rule us. Or find us our rights.” He uploaded video clips (unfortunately no longer available) featuring workers chanting, “We will not be ruled by the World Bank! We will not be ruled by colonialism!” On September 28, veteran unionist Sayyid Habib told Voice of America radio, “We are challenging the regime.”<strong>loc</strong> 2403</li>

<li><p>STRIKING BACK AT EGYPTIAN WORKERS HESHAM SALLAM<strong>loc</strong> 2447</p>

<ul>
<li>Among the elements of the crisis were the utter failure of top-down political reform, as shown in the shamelessly rigged 2010 legislative elections; mounting corruption and repression; emerging opportunities for collective action offered by networking sites like Facebook and Twitter; and the advent of neoliberal economic policies and the resulting constraints on the state’s capacity to deliver on its traditional obligations, such as social services, subsidies, price controls, and guaranteed employment for college graduates. There was considerable consensus that the revolution was—at least in part—a backlash against the exclusionary economic order that the deposed president’s son Gamal Mubarak and his associates helped to erect over the preceding decade.<strong>loc</strong> 2450</li>
<li>While most believe that there will be no return to the pre-January 25 political system, even if post-Mubarak Egypt is not fully democratic, workers may continue to be marginalized by the economic liberalization begun under the previous regime.<strong>loc</strong> 2459</li>
<li>ihtijajat fi’awiyya or small-group protests. The Arabic term fi’a simply means “group,” but has acquired negative connotations and might be compared with how the term “special interest” is used to disparage American labor.<strong>loc</strong> 2463</li>
<li>Only three days after Mubarak’s resignation, the SCAF released Communiqué 5, which outlined the negative impact of continuing protests on the economy and called on labor and professional syndicates to help bring about a return to normalcy in everyday life.1 A few days later, an army statement described “fi’awi demands” as illegitimate, pledging to deal with the agitators through legal means in the name of “protecting the security of the nation and its citizens.” On March 23, the government of Prime Minister ‘Isam Sharaf approved a law banning protests, assemblies, and strikes that impeded private and public business, and rendering such actions punishable with up to a year in prison and a fine that could reach a half-million Egyptian pounds.<strong>loc</strong> 2471</li>
<li>The dangers of fi’awi demands were said to be three. First, the workers who made them were accused of seeking to exploit the revolution to serve their own financial interest.<strong>loc</strong> 2485</li>
<li>Second, bread-and-butter demands were presented as a major challenge to Egypt’s economic prosperity and, therefore, national security.<strong>loc</strong> 2495</li>
<li>Third, so-called fi’awi protests, the narrative went, took their cues from affiliates of the formerly ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) stirring up trouble to reverse the gains of the revolution.<strong>loc</strong> 2506</li>
<li>As the spring wore on, and sectarian tensions began to preoccupy the national political debate, it became standard practice for pundits and commentators to list fi’awi protests together with sectarian strife as the two main channels through which forces of darkness were attempting to undermine the January 25 revolution.<strong>loc</strong> 2514</li>
<li>According to the Land Center for Human Rights, the number of labor protests in Egypt rose from 222 in 2006 to 756 in 2007 and exceeded 700 in 2009. Stated differently, well before January 25, 2011 the victims of economic liberalization among workers and civil servants had been loudly voicing their grievances, sometimes in highly visible locations, such as before the parliamentary building in downtown Cairo.<strong>loc</strong> 2520</li>
<li>While job actions were an important part of contentious politics in pre-January 25 Egypt, they were not demonized as fi’awi protests.<strong>loc</strong> 2542</li>
<li>‘Ala’ Sayf al-Islam wrote on May Day 2011: “Although labor strikes and demonstrations have been on the rise since 2006 and have not stopped since, and even though workers played an important role in bringing down Mubarak, we find the term ‘fi’awiyya’ being used as an insult. And suddenly we find that demands for just wages and respectable working conditions are portrayed as selfish…. Others go so far as to portray the strikes of Egyptian workers and employees as part of the counter-revolution and a conspiracy by the National Democratic Party.”<strong>loc</strong> 2546</li>
<li>By reinforcing the impression that the demands of discontented workers for more humane wages and working conditions were the mere product of parochial employee-management disputes inside various factories and bureaucracies, the term fi’awi did more than just stigmatize and dehistoricize these demands. Characterizing so-called fi’awi claims as the sum of a variety of disjointed narrow interests masked the serious national economic problems that these demonstrations and sit-ins collectively underscored.<strong>loc</strong> 2552</li>
<li>For decades, the state-controlled Egyptian Trade Union Federation enjoyed a legally sanctioned monopoly over the formal representation of workers and did more to rein in its members at the state’s behest than to lobby on their behalf.<strong>loc</strong> 2558</li>
<li>The problem, first and foremost, was and still is a national one, stemming from the failure of the state to deal with rising prices of basic goods such that a significant segment of Egyptian society remains stuck in a constant struggle to make ends meet. With inflation rates in the 2000s having reached levels not seen since the early 1990s and 40 percent of Egyptians living on less than $2 per day, the visible signs of socio-economic discontent, which so-called fi’awi protests epitomized, were not surprising.<strong>loc</strong> 2566</li>
<li>Riots over shortages in subsidized bread were widely reported in 2008 when bread sold at private bakeries became virtually unaffordable to many Egyptians after its price increased fivefold.<strong>loc</strong> 2570</li>
<li>The decline in quality and quantity of state social services forced many families to spend a good chunk of their paychecks on services that Egyptians used to take for granted, such as health care and education.<strong>loc</strong> 2572</li>
<li>extreme disparity in pay across management and junior staff within individual organizations,<strong>loc</strong> 2578</li>
<li>The unreflective deference that many opinion makers awarded to “the wheel of production” helped to sideline these pressing concerns even as millions of Egyptians were crushed under the wheel’s grinding rotation.<strong>loc</strong> 2581</li>
<li>the surge in worker unrest following Mubarak’s resignation highlighted the extent to which labor rights had deteriorated during the preceding years of crony capitalism. Mass layoffs and slashing of wages and benefits took place during the post-2004 rush toward economic liberalization under the Nazif government, particularly in the privatization of public-sector enterprises.<strong>loc</strong> 2586</li>
<li>It was estimated that in 2010 three million Egyptians were employed under contractual arrangements that gave their employers the de facto right to dismiss them at any moment.<strong>loc</strong> 2589</li>
<li>Many Egyptians decided to enter into these insecure contractual arrangements in the state sector and put up with monthly salaries not exceeding 100 Egyptian pounds in the hope that eventually they would be hired as full-time state employees, affording them a higher salary, more benefits, and—someday-a pension check.<strong>loc</strong> 2593</li>
<li>the government’s decision in 2010 to raise the monthly minimum wage from its 1984 level of 35 to 400 Egyptian pounds, slightly above the poverty line at $67, was meaningless from the perspective of the seven million Egyptians (including half the women in the work force) who work in the informal economy outside the reach of government scrutiny.<strong>loc</strong> 2598</li>
<li>In response to public outcry over the government’s decision to ban strikes and demonstrations, Prime Minister Sharaf told journalists in March that the purpose of the new law is to protect the revolution from fi’awi demonstrations.<strong>loc</strong> 2614</li>
<li>the month of January before the uprising witnessed an intensification of labor demonstrations and strikes. Whether these activities provided the impetus for mass participation in the uprising warrants further investigation, but at least these trends showed that many signs of public discontent revolved around redistributive demands immediately before the uprising-let alone years before it.<strong>loc</strong> 2622</li>
<li>the understandable focus of media reports on Tahrir Square and the cross-class unity there must not detract from the importance of labor unrest outside of the major squares during Mubarak’s final days.<strong>loc</strong> 2638</li>
<li>Some close observers, like the activist and blogger Hossam El-Hamalawy, believe that labor strikes in the last week of the uprising were the tipping point that forced Mubarak’s resignation.<strong>loc</strong> 2647</li>
<li>Yet the fact that one of the first things the SCAF tried to do after taking power was to bring an end to strikes suggests that work stoppages were a source of deep concern for the generals who surrounded Mubarak in his last days.<strong>loc</strong> 2649     Note: military ties to production/industry make this seem likely</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>SIGHTINGS OF THE EGYPTIAN DEEP STATE ISSANDR EL AMRANI<strong>loc</strong> 2696</p>

<ul>
<li>Having assumed power on February 10, 2011, the SCAF moved quickly to attain the stamp of popular legitimacy through a March 19 referendum on constitutional amendments.<strong>loc</strong> 2699</li>
<li>The SCAF’s plan, in brief, was to engineer a restoration of civilian rule that shielded the army’s political and economic prerogatives from civilian oversight, and perhaps bolstered those roles, yielding a system not unlike the “deep state” that prevailed for decades in Turkey.<strong>loc</strong> 2702</li>
<li>for much of the political class and a not inconsequential slice of public opinion, the violence of the early winter reduced the military’s moral authority to a level unseen since its defeat at Israel’s hands in 1967.<strong>loc</strong> 2706</li>
<li>Just as the deposed president, once deemed untouchable, became the butt of activist and media scorn from late 2004 onward, the military found itself subjected to unprecedented criticism and scrutiny.<strong>loc</strong> 2709</li>
<li>Egypt’s largest and closest-knit political party force, the Muslim Brothers, cozied up to the generals, who were comforted by the Brothers’ supposed ability to control the streets. The Brothers, officially outlawed under Mubarak and his predecessors, obtained a degree of “normalization,” as well as a transition plan that favored them.<strong>loc</strong> 2716</li>
<li>the Brothers were attracted by the generals’ blueprint putting parliamentary elections first—ahead of a completely new constitution that would allocate Parliament’s powers—because their superior numbers and organization made them most likely to succeed.<strong>loc</strong> 2723</li>
<li>The secularists had fallen into the Islamists’ trap of debates over identity, where they could never win, rather than respond to the public’s demands for social justice, prosperity, and law and order.<strong>loc</strong> 2731</li>
<li>Those activists who rejected formal politics or wished to work independently found themselves the target of reinvigorated security services; a state media machine that painted them as troublemakers and, increasingly, traitors; and the SCAF-led project to promote “stability” over “chaos” and “sectoral (fi’awi) demands,” code for supposedly parochial concerns whose expression was detrimental to national progress.<strong>loc</strong> 2734</li>
<li>In mid-February 2012, several activists were sent before military tribunals, which offer no possibility of appeal. The SCAF also continued to field civilian security services under the hated Emergency Law in place since 1981. In the autumn of 2011, other provisions of this law were invoked, such as the prohibition upon public gatherings of more than five persons.<strong>loc</strong> 2738</li>
<li>It is unclear what effect the expiration of the Emergency Law in May 2012 will have on the SCAF’s security operations.<strong>loc</strong> 2741     Note: look into this</li>
<li>The SCAF was slow to arrest kingpins of the old regime, and its military police maltreated protesters in March and April 2011, as with the infamous “virginity tests” of women.<strong>loc</strong> 2744</li>
<li>The protest movement’s mounting dissatisfaction culminated in the reoccupation of Tahrir Square that July. Another turning point was the October 9 confrontation at the state broadcasting headquarters, known as Maspero, in which twenty-five protesters for Coptic rights died at the hands of army troops.<strong>loc</strong> 2745</li>
<li>The protesters focused their ire on “supra-constitutional principles” drafted by then Deputy Prime Minister ‘Ali al-Salmi, an attempt to predetermine basic tenets of a new constitution as well as rules for the composition of the future constitutional assembly. Among the proposed measures: guaranteed secrecy for the military budget and SCAF authority to impose its own constituent assembly should the body appointed by Parliament fail to agree upon a draft national charter.<strong>loc</strong> 2752</li>
<li>The decision by Salafi groups and the Muslim Brothers to back the November 18 demonstration marked the Islamist forces’ first public break with the SCAF.<strong>loc</strong> 2757</li>
<li>The November-December violence stemmed from the state’s decision to send in riot police to clear out these remaining demonstrators. The police used considerable force, prompting the full reoccupation of Tahrir Square and a fracas on the adjoining Muhammad Mahmoud Street that claimed forty lives and wounded hundreds, many of them critically. Police snipers were found to be aiming for protesters’ heads; several activists lost an eye, including one who had lost a first eye in January. The massive use of tear gas over the ensuing week shrouded much of central Cairo in an acrid cloud, afflicting hundreds, if not more, with serious ailments.<strong>loc</strong> 2764</li>
<li>parliamentary elections began on November 28, drawing large crowds to polling stations.<strong>loc</strong> 2779</li>
<li>The country was riveted by the elections and, in particular, by the success of the Muslim Brothers and the Salafis, who respectively garnered some 40 percent and 20 percent of seats in the first round.<strong>loc</strong> 2785</li>
<li>Most astonishing to Egyptians, however, was the behavior of military police and other soldiers. Never, they shook their heads, had men in khaki uniforms been allowed to behave so wantonly. Snipers were apparently used to kill protesters, including a prominent al-Azhar sheikh, ‘Imad ‘Iffat, who had come to broker a truce. Soldiers were captured on camera urinating on protesters from atop buildings and assaulting women, such as the “girl with the blue bra,” a volunteer doctor at the Tahrir Square field hospital whose brutal stomping was gasped at worldwide.<strong>loc</strong> 2795</li>
<li>Freedom and Justice Party (FJP)—<strong>loc</strong> 2812    Note: brotherhood’s party</li>
<li>The Brothers’ decision to stay out of the streets, their insistence on elections being paramount, their disdain for the protest movement, which at times echoed SCAF talking points—all this earned them the opprobrium of many activists.<strong>loc</strong> 2821</li>
<li>While the army may have been the bedrock of the post-1952 Egyptian state, the country’s array of security agencies now crosses the boundaries between civilian and military.<strong>loc</strong> 2832</li>
<li>The strongest security agency in post-Mubarak Egypt continues to be the General Intelligence Services (GIS), which gleans its senior staff from the military and whose only loss in January was its head, ‘Umar Sulayman, who briefly served as Mubarak’s first and last vice president.<strong>loc</strong> 2836</li>
<li>Sulayman’s successor at the GIS was one of his former deputies, Murad Muwafi, a veteran of Egypt’s mediation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Muwafi was made a full member of the SCAF and played a key role there alongside the “big three” generals believed to run the body: Tantawi, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Sami ‘Inan and Commander of the Army’s Central Command Hasan Ruwayni.<strong>loc</strong> 2841</li>
<li>It is worth recalling what the SCAF is, or rather, what it is not: The SCAF is not modeled on the chain of command in the armed forces, and its members have widely different degrees of interaction with, and influence upon, civilian affairs. Only half of the body is composed of military officers who occupy top billets in the army’s organogram, such as commander of the air force or navy. The rest are political officers, mainly lieutenants of Tantawi who held senior positions at the Ministry of Defense (and who often appear on television as spokesmen), or officers drawn from the GIS or the military’s own intelligence service (often a career precursor to a GIS assignment). The method by which the SCAF makes decisions, its frequent slowness in doing so, and the confusion that prevails (or is allowed to linger) over the manner in which it handles security issues, in particular—all these things are a mystery, even by the army’s customary standard of opacity.<strong>loc</strong> 2849</li>
<li>The dramatic moves by newly-elected President Muhammad Mursi on August 12, 2012— retiring Gens. Tantawi, ‘Inan and Muwafi and and promoting a younger generation of officers; and canceling an amendment to the Constitutional Declaration issued by the SCAF on the last day of the presidential election in June 2012 that castrated the incoming president and gave the SCAF wide continued powers—were, in a sense, confirmation that the military is not a unitary actor. It was notable that the new Defense Minister, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi (formerly head of Military Intelligence), is the second- youngest general in the SCAF and his second-in-command, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Sedky Sobhy (formerly Commander of the Third Army) the youngest.<strong>loc</strong> 2864</li>

<li><p>EGYPT’S GENERALS AND TRANSNATIONAL CAPITAL SHANA MARSHALL AND JOSHUA STACHER<strong>loc</strong> 2877</p>

<ul>
<li>Before and after the ejection of Husni Mubarak from office, the size of the Egyptian army’s share in the economy has been a subject of great debate. The army is known to manufacture everything from olive oil and shoe polish to the voting booths used in Egypt’s 2011 parliamentary elections, but no one knows for sure how much of the country’s economy the military industries control.<strong>loc</strong> 2879</li>
<li>“Military, Inc.”<strong>loc</strong> 2885</li>
<li>Not only are army holdings classified as state secrets—reporting on them can land a journalist in jail—but they are also too vast and dispersed to estimate with any confidence.<strong>loc</strong> 2886</li>
<li>The military’s oldest commercial interests are the factories run by the Ministry of Military Production, the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) and the National Service Projects Organization. But the army also oversees numerous subsidiaries of state-owned holding companies and owns shares in public-private ventures. In many cases, these smaller operations are embedded in transnational conglomerates that reach into several economic sectors, from construction and maritime shipping to weapons manufacturing.<strong>loc</strong> 2887</li>
<li>Conventional wisdom is that the Egyptian military seeks to uphold such Nasser-era legacies as a sizable public sector and a protectionist trade policy. The 2011 uprising strengthened this belief, particularly after the defenestration of Gamal Mubarak and his circle, masterminds of the aggressive neoliberal reform carried out under Prime Minister Ahmad Nazif from 2004-2010.<strong>loc</strong> 2892</li>
<li>In a September 2008 State Department cable published by WikiLeaks, then-Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey called the military’s conglomerates “quasi-commercial,” concluding that the government’s privatization schemes were viewed “as a threat to [the military’s] economic position” and that the military “generally opposes economic reforms.” Scobey’s predecessor Frank Ricciardone had made a similar argument in a March 2008 cable: “[Field Marshal Hussein] Tantawi believes that Egypt’s economic reform plan fosters social instability by lessening [government] controls over prices and production.”<strong>loc</strong> 2897</li>
<li>In retrospect, it seems clear that while the military-industrial complex resisted the privatization pursued by Ahmad Nazif’s cabinet, their recalcitrance was predicated on two fears: first, that military operations would be next on the chopping block and second, that the private-sector oligarchs close to Gamal would eclipse Military, Inc. in Egypt’s political economy. Tenders of privatization are excludable goods, and the more of them were granted to Gamal’s cronies, the fewer remained for military companies, which sought them just as assiduously.<strong>loc</strong> 2921</li>
<li>In tandem with transnational capital, the army sought to corner markets even as it espoused free-market nostrums. And Military, Inc. may do the Mubaraks one better: With Gamal’s crony capitalist allies out of the way, there is no longer any competitor whose ambitions are a counterweight to the army’s appetite for economic expansion.<strong>loc</strong> 2930<br></li>
<li>Military, Inc. has accordingly inaugurated projects in sectors ranging from maritime transport to oil and gas exploration and renewable energy. Contrary to the army’s reputation as a pillar of protectionism, these projects are collaborative, bringing in Gulf conglomerates, as well as Western and Asian multinationals, as partners.<strong>loc</strong> 2939<br></li>
<li>The military had been diversifying its holdings long before the uprising, through expansion into sectors like real estate development and heavy equipment leasing, in which the military’s enormous land holdings, infrastructure, and capital provided major advantages, as well as the privately owned businesses that constitute what became known as the “officer economy.” The army’s tentacles also grasped large shares of the civilian public sector as part of the “privatization” process in the 1990s. Alexandria Shipyard, for instance, was turned over to the Ministry of Defense in August 2007. It now produces large merchant vessels and warships and offers its repair services to private shipping companies.<strong>loc</strong> 2946</li>
<li>The Egyptian military has actively pursued partnerships with overseas firms in all of these sectors, primarily under the rubric of public-private partnerships—a mechanism of development economics that also meets the strictures of neoliberal policy planners.<strong>loc</strong> 2968</li>
<li>renewed pressure from World Trade Organization members with major shipping interests led the government to adopt a master plan (2001-2017) to extend the liberalization of maritime activities. This plan included the introduction of the “landlord model,” whereby private-sector firms fulfill many port functions, but remain under the supervision profit-oriented and nominally independent (but still state-owned) entities.<strong>loc</strong> 2978</li>
<li>By the middle of the decade, Egypt’s ports were experiencing what a 2008 USAID report termed an “investment stampede,” which included sizeable new investments from four of the world’s largest maritime conglomerates: the Danish Moeller-Maersk, the French CMA CGM, and Cosco Pacific and Hutchison Port Holdings, both of Hong Kong.<strong>loc</strong> 2981</li>
<li>These joint ventures represent tens of billions of dollars in investment from foreign firms, state banks, and international lenders; even the military’s minority share in these companies is a substantial asset.<strong>loc</strong> 2988</li>
<li>The revenue of Military, Inc. from the maritime sector may also explain the degree of violence meted out to strikers and other protesters around Egypt’s ports, which are often incorporated into “special economic zones” where regulation is minimal and tax incentives are high.<strong>loc</strong> 3012</li>
<li>As with maritime transport, the military is in a good position to benefit from overseas investment in Egypt’s energy sector, where it exercises nearly as much formal control as the Ministry of Petroleum.<strong>loc</strong> 3020</li>
<li>The payoff for foreign conglomerates that go into business with Military, Inc. is largely the same system of benefits that Egypt’s civilian oligarchs have enjoyed, including preferential treatment in bidding for state contracts, privileged access to infrastructure and services, and advance notice of pending projects. The biggest perk, however, is being able to rely on Egyptian soldiers to secure corporate assets—a type of insurance no other state actor can provide.<strong>loc</strong> 3055</li>
<li>From the outset of the uprising, army leaders went to great lengths to assure outsiders that ports, oil and gas facilities, and other critical sites were operating normally under the watch of armed forces and police.17 As the army consolidated the additional leverage it accrued as Egypt’s transitional government, its merits as a business partner became clearer: Not only do foreign investors get soldiers to safeguard their assets, but they also get the political connections that have always been the path to economic gain in Egypt.<strong>loc</strong> 3065     Note: role of outside parties</li>
<li>The generals’ antipathy for Gamal Mubarak led many to assume they also disdained all neoliberal projects. The guessing similarly obscured the fact that, in an era of transnational capital, the army’s footprint is found in many places outside the formally state-owned holding companies.<strong>loc</strong> 3076</li>
<li>transition. The furor over the obscene wealth of Mubarak’s private-sector cronies presented the military with a golden opportunity to eliminate rivals.<strong>loc</strong> 3082</li>
<li>civilian businessmen with strong links to military companies were passed over by prosecutors—another signal to politicians to accept the military’s role in the economy or be shut out altogether.<strong>loc</strong> 3087</li>
<li>The remaining seats are allotted according to proportional representation, and although this system might have allowed for contests reflective of party-based platforms, the SCAF’s demand to hold elections so soon after Mubarak’s resignation meant that most potential challengers were too weak and disorganized to mount a meaningful campaign.<strong>loc</strong> 3090</li>
<li>The result was a parliament in near lockstep with the military on economic governance.<strong>loc</strong> 3103</li>
<li>the parties that command almost 87 percent of the assembly—Freedom and Justice, the salafi Nour Party, the Wafd and the Egyptian Bloc—all endorse the continued pursuit of neoliberalism.<strong>loc</strong> 3104</li>
<li>In addition to electoral engineering, the SCAF engaged in both overt repression and legal chicanery to quiet those excluded from the political arena in the months following the elections. Not only did the generals make it a crime to organize protests that disrupted the economy, deftly exempting “thuggery” from the list of acts that are no longer punishable under emergency law, they also encouraged the notion that labor strikes were undermining the national economy.<strong>loc</strong> 3107</li>
<li>Together with the sowing of fear and discord, such coercion served as a deterrent to labor actions and street demonstrations that challenged the neoliberal program. The aim was not to imprison every demonstrator, but to dissuade the discontented from protesting in the first place.<strong>loc</strong> 3113</li>
<li>Egyptians were thus offered a familiar Hobson’s choice: Acquiesce to a slightly adapted status quo in order to restore “stability,” or return to the streets and invite the resumption of chaos. Elections, whatever their benefits, gave the authorities a broader mandate to repress dissent and recruit new enablers of the military’s rent-seeking behavior. Military, Inc. is determined that its holdings and operations remain beyond public scrutiny. The real Machiavellian turn in Egypt is just how many Islamists, liberals, nationalists and unaffiliated actors are content to watch the military’s economic empire grow at the expense of those clamoring for political change and social justice.<strong>loc</strong> 3115  Note: ouch</li>
