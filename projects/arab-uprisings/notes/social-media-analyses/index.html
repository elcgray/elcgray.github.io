  <h2>Arab Spring/General Commentary</h2>

<p><strong>Tunisia:</strong> When blogger Alaa Abdel Fatah was asked for his thoughts on who would come to power, he said &quot;I don’t think anyone is worried about who will rule, if we don’t like them we will change them, if not through elections [then] through another revolt&quot; <a href="#sarnelli">(Sarnelli, 2013, p. 163)</a>.</p>

<h4>There&#39;s a dark side to technology.</h4>

<ul>
<li>Amid the cheerleading over recent events in the Middle East, it&#39;s easy to forget the more repressive uses of technology. In addition to the rosy narrative celebrating how Facebook and Twitter have enabled freedom movements around the world, we need to confront a more sinister tale: how greedy companies, fostered by Western governments for domestic surveillance needs, have helped suppress them <a href="#morozov">(Morozov, 2011)</a>.</li>
<li>some Western companies supply dictators with customized solutions to block offensive Web sites...the American government, the world&#39;s most vociferous defender of &#39;&#39;Internet freedom,&#39;&#39; has little to say about such complicity <a href="#morozov">(Morozov, 2011)</a>.</li>
<li>Left uncontrolled, Western surveillance tools could undermine the &#39;&#39;Internet freedom&#39;&#39; agenda in the same way arms exports undermine Western-led peace initiatives <a href="#morozov">(Morozov, 2011)</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>digital media and information infrastructure may have influ enced the Arab Spring, but their future political and democratic capacities depend now on the policy battles being waged and technological affordances being forged by transnational infrastructure stakeholders <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 38)</a></li>
<li>devel oping and authoritarian states have also been actively coordinating amongst each other to bring global north-anchored Internet infrastructure under their influence <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 38)</a></li>
<li>Internet freedom promotion since the Arab Spring has been a contentious site for multi-sector competition and negotiations <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 40)</a></li>
<li>many democracies are beginning to treat technology infrastructure development as a critical component of broad democracy promotion efforts <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 41)</a></li>
<li>all states, democratic and authoritarian, routinely interfere with digital systems in the name of national security <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 46)</a></li>
<li>The Arab Spring has helped to bring these tech-savvy activists to the forefront of Internet freedom promotion, so it has become in the best interest of states promoting Internet freedom to incor porate these civil society stakeholders into their norm-consolidation efforts and policy-development projects exhibited in the Internet freedom meetings following the Arab Spring <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, pp. 49-50)</a></li>
<li>Civil society actors, however, view digital infrastructure as a much more malleable environment, capable of being redesigned with new affordances that can better promote Internet freedom both through its architecture as well as its regulations and policies <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 50)</a></li>
<li>Whereas state actors tend to understate—and technology providers tend to undermine—the political significance of communications tech nologies, this technical community of Internet freedom activists shares a set of normative beliefs about the digital informational tools they want to examine and design to aid democracy promoters <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, p. 51)</a></li>
<li>technology companies also enable, support, and threaten the end users’ (i.e., Internet users) freedom of speech, access to information, and freedom to associate, and therefore share a burden of responsibility towards their users—something the states are more likely to disregard <a href="#hussain">(Hussain, 2014, pp. 53-54)</a></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Does radical openness operate the same globally as in the US?
Williams: You need only look at the Arab Spring to see that no country is immune to the forces of radical openness. That said, it’s clear that the US and other Western nations with a history of democratic traditions and with widespread access to modern technologies are well ahead of newly emerging democracies and countries like North Korea or Iran where the forces of openness are aggressively curtailed by the current regimes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But complain as we might, what can replace what we have today? What comes the day after the Arab Spring?”</p>

<p>Look at networks such as Facebook or Twitter. Facebook is an interesting example, where a mere 3,000 employees govern 900 million people. But privatized communities are not bottom-up democracies. They cannot replace government. “Friending someone on Facebook does not do the hard work of governance,” she says firmly.
Officials can learn something from such organizations, however. Open platforms and the explosion of apps sets a precedent for thinking about “opening up the API of government.” As Noveck says: “The next great superpower will be one to combine the hierarchy of the institution — because we need to retain public values and coordinate flow — with diversity, chaos and the excitement of networks.”</p>

<p>“The last thing, the most important thing for us to do is demand this revolution. We don’t have words really to describe it yet. Equality, fairness in the traditional sense, are not great terms yet. They’re not fun or exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us. If we want to see the hopeful, exciting kinds of innovations in clean energy and education and development, if we want to see those adopted and scaled, we must all participate. Open up institutions and let the nutrients flow throughout our culture to create open institutions, a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Because governments used to have control over the propaganda channels, the communication channels, the printing presses, the radio stations… When you would take over a country, you would take over these things and indoctrinate the population and use propaganda. Now, anyone has a printing press, and they can put out revolutionary pamphlets. So because they are freaking out, they are overreacting.
So not only is it unsustainable, it’s also causing this overreaction. We see this again and again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People talk about the social network revolution. It’s obvious that Twitter and Facebook do not cause a revolution, and they don’t overthrow governments. Years of dictatorship, years of overreach and years of abuse cause people to want to overthrow governments. Social media and the web — open access to information — are tools and the scaffolding that allows this to happen, and allows the world to know. We can sit right here now in Vancouver, and we can know about what is happening in Caracas, what is happening in Turkey, what is happening in Egypt, in Tunisia.
There’s a lot of responsibility on the companies that run these services — on Facebook and Twitter and on the foundations of the Internet. And a lot of that responsibility lies with American companies. And here, here’s the rub — all this power, all these companies, are based in the US, and the US government, the most powerful Western democracy in the world, has been trying to manipulate and control the web. It makes other governments feel like maybe it’s okay to do this sort of thing. If the Americans don’t make a fuss about it, why should anyone else? That erodes the sense of democracy.&quot;</p>

<p>A lot of this complexity rises from the relationship between corporations and governments. You have to kind of hope that multinational corporations have the responsibility, they have the right morals and the values. But they’re not democratic government. They’re businesses that make money. Their ethos is usually the bottom line, the shareholder value. All though they try to “do no evil”  – is that really possible?</p>

<p>The web giants hold the world in their hands. What will they do? How will they react? Will they make business decisions or will this be about values? It’s very unclear, and we’re in the first skirmishes of the future of this world. To me it is very clear that the power of multinational conglomerates is extremely important. It’s not just what the NSA or the US government or even the Turkish government does. There are a lot of moral decisions on the shoulders of CEOs.</p>

<p>This is why the nature of the Internet originated as decentralized, but in essence we’re losing that aspect of it. Because it’s not so decentralized any more. It’s almost feudal. There is a small group of landowners, and we live on their land.</p>

<p>Hackers have evolved as the web has evolved. They’re an integral part of it. And they’re a vital role in it. It’s not organized, it’s not orderly, a lot of them do bad stuff. But overall, I’m hopeful about it. Because for me, it means that this world we live in, which is more and more reliant on digital services, which are run by money-driven corporations, also has someone that can be the counterbalance. They alert our attention to what is happening and to the threats (technical and social). I think that’s important.</p>

<p>Lots of governments are analog guys in a digital world, and they think they’ll just shut it down. You can’t. It just doesn’t work that way. But secondly, they’re also positioning themselves as an “us vs them.” They think they can cordon themselves off or build a secure environment. Hackers gonna hack. They’re going to take down those walls. So there is no such thing as unhackable. And even if we could design an unhackable world, I don’t know if I’d want to live there. That sounds kind of like The Matrix. It’s totally controlled and organized by the AI. That’s kind of creepy.</p>

<p>The Internet is a basic human right. And our world is changing. Really, we are moving towards that Matrix kind of reality where our lives, our brains, will be backed up to the cloud. And who controls that cloud? Who says what’s okay and not okay to go on the cloud, or on the Internet of things? We have these technologies, but we haven’t thought about these implications. The technology’s out faster than we know what to do with it. Policy is way behind, politics is way behind, governments are way behind. Even the corporations that are building it, companies like Amazon, Google, they’re building AIs and drones — are they thinking about the meaning of it? These technologies can quickly become our new overlords, while national governments are still stuck in 20th century reforms.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://blog.ted.com/social-movements-beyond-twitter-zeynep-tufekci-live-at-tedglobal-2014/">http://blog.ted.com/social-movements-beyond-twitter-zeynep-tufekci-live-at-tedglobal-2014/</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be sure, online networks have had a profound impact on social movements. Says Tufekci, both tear gas and Twitter were everywhere in Tahrir and Gezi. With mainstream media outlets censored by the government, as “editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do,” citizens started to collect online, snapping photos of police brutality and government hypocrisy and posting them on Twitter. Watching subsequent movements in Ukraine, Hong Kong, Bahrain and Tunisia, social change itself seems to be going viral.
Yet for all these new tools for scaling social movements, actual political change isn’t happening at nearly the same rate as the speed of Twitter. “For these movements, achievements are not proportional to the size and energy they inspired,” Tufekci says. “Their hopes are misaligned with what they are able to achieve.”
Tufekci’s insight: “The way technology empowers social movements can paradoxically weaken them.” Consider the American civil rights movements. When Rosa Parks was arrested, people got the word out by working all night, mimeographing 52,000 leaflets and distributing them by hand. The protest was organized by having its members do something we can’t fathom today – meeting face to face to get things done. And through that, says Tufekci, “They created the kind of organization that could think together, create consensus, innovate, keep going together through differences.” She asks: “Are we overlooking some of the benefits of doing things the hard way?”</p>

<p>The problem with social movements today, says Tufekci, is not that their participants lack heart or that they fail to forge true bonds among themselves, as some have argued. Like startups that grow too quickly, she says, movements need to learn to scale beyond the fast participation that’s made possible from online networks. “All these good intentions and bravery and sacrifice by themselves are not going to be enough,” says Tufekci.
“Changing minds is the bedrock of changing politics over the long term.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The global downturn has forced an opening up of society. Old systems are failing us — “The failure of Wall Street almost brought down capitalism,” he says — and this has made the world into a burning platform. Radical difference is our only option, and the combination of the push of both technology and demography and the pull from a broken global economy is causing the world to open up. “We’re at a turning point in human history,” he says. And he goes on to outline the open world according to four principles:
* Collaboration
* Transparency
* Sharing
* Empowerment</p>

<p>This time of great change is not without problems, Tapscott allows. There’s little leadership at the head of these movements. Unsavory forces can fill vacuums left after the swift change. But it doesn’t matter. “We’re not putting this back in the bottle,” Tapscott says. “The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.”</p>

<p>And this change is positive, he adds. Hundreds of years ago, knowledge was tightly concentrated in a system of feudalism and agrarianism. Then Gutenberg arrived with a printing press and knowledge began to distribute itself. We moved to the Industrial Age and now, with the Internet Age, the technological genie is once again out of the bottle, allowing us all to be a producer. “This is not an information age, it’s an age of networked intelligence, an age of vast promise.”</p>

<p>Tapscott concludes with some research he’s done recently, over some beautiful film of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8eZJnbDHIg&amp;feature=related">murmuration of starlings</a>. It’s spectacular footage that shows the synchronized, collective genius of the birds, which chase away predators and demonstrate leadership without having any one leader. The birds exhibit a beautiful sense of interdependence that we might want to understand and apply in our own lives. “I look at this and I get a lot of hope,” he says. “Could we create some kind of collective intelligence that goes beyond an individual or team to create a consciousness on a global basis?”</p>

<p>The Internet can make that which is on the opposite end of the world seem very local. Yet this can both distort or amplify reality. For example, while the recent “Innocence of Muslims” video served as a catalyst for the dissatisfaction felt toward the lack of Western support toward the Arab world, the protests and riots would not have occurred without YouTube and Vimeo. The ways by which newer and older media come together can turn slander into reality, changing what counts as truth in today’s world.</p>

<p>Scholars and critics understand that revolutions happen in waves, and that at certain early stages social media technologies play a more salient role.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The political scientist Samuel Huntington in his 1968 book Political Order in Changing Societies noted that revolutions are never made by the poor; they are made by upwardly mobile, urban middle class activists whose hopes and expectations are thwarted by the existing political system. Students invariably play a key role in such uprisings.</p>

<p>He went on to say, however, that this type of middle class individual almost never finishes the revolution, unless he or she is successful in connecting with the rural masses.</p>

<p>Facebook, which went public last week, has been credited with helping to build democracy internationally. It is true that it and other social media have democratized access to information, and have made collaboration easier. These media have also helped promote short-term mobilization of crowds and demonstrators. But networking is not organization-building. For that, we need a different and more durable platform.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon has long relied on broadcast media for real-time information gathering, and before television, officials leaned on newspapers for publicly available intelligence.
However, while the sources of information are publicly available, the reports made based on the information are kept classified. And while the agency insists it will not use the information to monitor individuals or domestic affairs, some critics are sceptical, wondering whether the data is fairly obtained and how it will be used.

<p>Evgeny Morozov believes communication tools themselves should not be given more credit for a revolution than the political, social, or economic conditions that can also instigate dramatic changes.</p>

<p>He says that like the telegraph in the 1917 Bolshevik revolution and the tape recorder in the 1979 Iranian revolution, technology’s role will appear less relevant decades later.</p>

<p>To make his point, Morozov emphasizes the support that bloggers and social media activists often receive from western governments, companies and organisations through technology conferences, particularly if activists are using technology to support a pro-democracy movement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judging by the failed Iranian uprising of 2009, social media in particular provides dictators with all the information they need for an effective crackdown. Monitoring a revolutionary movement has never been easier - the secret police just need to collect enough tweets and pokes. Thus, while it&#39;s important to recognise the positive contribution that social media can and does make to popular uprisings, it&#39;s equally important to recognise its shortcomings and vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Now authoritarian governments rely on a rapidly expanding panoply of tools and tactics that range from distributed denial-of-service attacks to make websites temporarily unavailable, to spreading malware that helps them to spy on dissidents remotely. Merely funding censorship circumvention tools as a means of weakening authoritarian control no longer seems sufficient and may actually encourage dictators to replace technological controls with social ones, such as pressuring internet companies to remove political comments from their sites.
Another reason why those of us living in democracies should pay more attention to how dictators control the web is because it is the only way to identify and put pressure on western corporations that make such control possible by selling them the equipment.</p>

<p>The Egyptian government had the ability to monitor and intercept traffic passing through their networks thanks to &quot;deep packet inspection&quot; technology sold to state-owned Telecom Egypt by the American firm Narus (owned by Boeing).</p>

<p>The way in which we choose to regulate such technologies in the west can really define - and perhaps, even limit - their contribution to political oppression.</p>

<p>Sadly, the likes of Facebook and Twitter do not have a spotless record on digital activism. For all the celebration of their role in facilitating democratic change, neither company has so far joined the Global Network Initiative, a group of companies, civil organisations and academics committed to upholding human rights and freedom of expression in telecommunications (Microsoft, Google and Yahoo have all joined). Many dissidents around the globe are unhappy that Facebook systematically deletes their accounts because their profiles bear pseudonyms, not their real names.</p>

<p>Getting US companies to stop selling technology to authoritarian states that are likely to abuse it would be a good first step; having Facebook, Twitter and others commit to some shared set of democratic norms would be a good second.</p>

<p>Companies aside, the biggest challenge to internet freedom lies in western democracies themselves, where law enforcement and intelligence agencies want to assert greater control over our networks. The rapid securitisation of cyberspace is particularly severe in the US, where the government, spooked by the WikiLeaks saga, is opting for a more aggressive watch over the internet.
The fact that the US government is trying to export internet freedom abroad while limiting it at home is not lost on its adversaries, who skillfully exploit such hypocrisy for propaganda. The push to promote internet freedom should aim as much inward as it does outward.</p>

<p>Well, people power has been there for a while. It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India, it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle. It helped a local, Lech Walesa, to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland, and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s new in it? What seems to be very new, which is the idea I would like to share with you today, is that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle. If this is true, we can help these movements.</p>

<p>What is the average age of an Egyptian? 24. How long was Mubarak in power? 31. So, this system was just obsolete, they expired. And young people of the Arab world have awakened one morning, and understood that power lies in their hands. The rest is the year in front of us. And guess what? The same Generation Y, with their rules, with their tools, with their games, and with their language, which sounds a little bit strange to me. I&#39;m 38 now. And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe? It seems that Generation Y is coming.</p>

<p>They will say: &quot;People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive.&quot; They will say: &quot;People power will work, if the annual income of the country is between X and Z.&quot; They will say: &quot;People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure.&quot; They will say: &quot;People power will work only if there is no oil.&quot; And, I mean, there is a set of conditions. Well, the news here is that your skills during the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions. Namely, the skills of unity, planning, and maintaining nonviolent discipline.</p>

<p>Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution. That thing doesn&#39;t exist in the world. Whenever you see young people in front of the row trying to fraternize with the police or military, somebody was thinking about it before.</p>

<p>Now, everybody is talking about His Majesty, the Internet, and it is also a very useful skill. But don&#39;t rush to label things like &quot;a Facebook Revolution,&quot; &quot;Twitter Revolution.&quot; Don&#39;t [confuse] the tools with the substance. It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper. They also make it a bit safer for the participants, because they give partial anonymity.
We&#39;re watching the great example of something else the Internet can do. It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester. This is the famous group &quot;We are all Khaled Said,&quot; made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt, and his friend. This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police. This is how he became known to the public, and this is what probably became the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back.
But here is also the bad news. The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world, in the streets. You will never change your society towards democracy, or, you know, the economy, if you sit down and click. There are risks to be taken, and there are living people who are winning the struggle.</p>

<p>Will these revolutions be pushed through the transitions and democracy or be overtaken by the military or extremists of all kinds? We cannot tell. The same works for the Western sector, where you can see all these excited young people protesting around the world, occupying this, occupying that. Are they going to become the world wave? Are they going to find their skills, their enthusiasm, and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform, or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate? This is the difference between the two paths.</p>

<p>Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years? Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mali, Madagascar, Poland, the Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on, and now Tunisia and Egypt. And this hasn&#39;t just happened. A lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp. He wrote a book called &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy&quot; with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance. And it&#39;s been translated into 26 languages. It&#39;s flown around the world. And it&#39;s being used by young people and older people everywhere, because it works and it&#39;s effective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For decades, we have lived under authoritarian regimes -- in the Arab world, in the Middle East. These regimes created something within us during this period. I&#39;m 43 years old right now. For the last 40 years, I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old, aged, authoritarian, corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us. And for a moment I was wondering, are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground, a change that does not come through foreign intervention, through the misery of occupation, through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?</p>

<p>Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived. A new generation, well-educated, connected, inspired by universal values and a global understanding, has created a new reality for us. We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams: these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world, who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets. Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing. Just step out of your house, raise your voice and say, &quot;We would like to see the end of the regime.&quot;</p>

<p>I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset. But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from. And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change, before we thought, and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us, and people rejected that, because they thought that it is alien to their culture. Always, we believed that change will spring from within, that change should be a reconciliation with culture, cultural diversity, with our faith in our tradition and in our history, but at the same time, open to universal values, connected with the world, tolerant to the outside. And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world. This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region.</p>
