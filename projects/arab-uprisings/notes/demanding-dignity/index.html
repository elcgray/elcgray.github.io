  <h1 class="page-title">Notes | Demanding Dignity</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Since 1975, the United States has pumped more than 28 billion dollars in military and economic aid into Egypt, but it has turned a blind eye to the government’s pervasive corruption, human rights violations, and decades of election rigging. While corruption was largely assumed and suspected, empirical evidence was often missing. Wikileaks changed that. <strong>loc</strong> 120   - Note: role of wikileaks?</li>
<li>Western-backed dictators ruled for decades, capitalizing upon the growing class divide and seldom displaying transparency in governance. <strong>loc</strong> 123</li>
<li>Civil unrest was equated with terrorism, and the West continued to prop up the authoritarian leaders in pursuit of oil deals and geo-political convenience. <strong>loc</strong> 126</li>
<li>Whether in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, or Morocco, a growing awareness that these governments represented the interests of others, rather than their own citizens, manifested itself in society. <strong>loc</strong> 127</li>
<li>Arab leaders often used the word “democracy”—even Mubarak’s political party used the name National Democratic Party—but political participation and social equity had been largely ignored for decades. <strong>loc</strong> 130</li>
<li>Many turned to religion to find purpose or answers. The hope behind endorsing a unifying Islamic identity rested on a desire to return to a moment of civilizational greatness that preceded Western colonization. <strong>loc</strong> 132</li>
<li>Arab youth, who make up the majority of the population in the region’s countries, were inheriting false promises and broken societies. <strong>loc</strong> 138</li>
<li>This basic lack of opportunity punctuated by staggering humiliation might have atrophied hope, but it paradoxically appeared to propel spirits—inciting widespread revolts we’ve seen catch fire from one country to the next. <strong>loc</strong> 140<br></li>
<li>In many ways, the protest movements of the Arab world have re-inspired Americans to challenge corruption at home. <strong>loc</strong> 163</li>
<li>The message is now clear: citizens of the Arab world are no longer to be feared by the West, just as they no longer fear their own leaders or shy away from the right to practice free speech. New generations of Arabs are reclaiming what it means to be Arab. Through the democratization of media and technology—specifically new disruptive publishing platforms and social media—this connected generation of Arabs has found power in numbers online and ways to translate those numbers into the streets. <strong>loc</strong> 166   - Note: manifesto?</li>
<li>When the Internet arrived in the Middle East and North Africa/Maghreb in the early nineties, the region’s youth found a platform to escape but also to connect. They confronted their challenges, their dreams, and each other in the virtual realm. In some countries, blatant censorship of Internet content became an explicit reminder to youth of the tentacles of dictatorship reaching into their lives. It even inspired this tech-savvy generation to work around web restrictions through innovative and entrepreneurial projects. <strong>loc</strong> 172</li>
<li>On January 27, 2011, just as President Obama appeared live on YouTube to answer questions submitted from the American public, Egypt’s President Hosni Mubarak shut down the Internet in an attempt to crush the popular uprising in his country. <strong>loc</strong> 177</li>
<li><p>Al Jazeera, like social media, played a crucial role in amplifying the voices of those who had finally come out in large numbers to be heard—connecting them with millions of others in the region and billions more the world over. Yet it was the people’s voices that were echoing from rooftops and public squares across the region chanting: Allahu Akbar (God is Great!) and Ash-sha‘ab yureed isqat an-nizam! (The people want the fall of the regime!). <strong>loc</strong> 183</p></li>
<li><p>Why We Care Maytha Alhassen <strong>loc</strong> 187</p>

<ul>
<li>we were all shocked that the brother we regionally neglected as a significant player in pan-Arab affairs, Tunisia, started it all. <strong>loc</strong> 245</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ahmed Shihab-Eldin <strong>loc</strong> 251</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>loc</strong> 262</li>
<li>Tweets and videos popped up on the Internet from Tunisia, warning of trouble to come in the region. Protesters called for help from hacktivist groups. Tunisia’s government began hacking into and deleting Facebook accounts. And soon enough, another hashtag appeared across the networks, “#Anonymous.” Within a matter of hours, Anonymous launched “Operation Tunisia,” paralyzing the president’s website, several key ministries, and the stock exchange. <strong>loc</strong> 264<br></li>
<li>On January 12, 2011, with Ben Ali’s regime on the verge of collapse, Time Magazine reported the story. But the story was already out there online, documented in photographs shot with mobile phones and streaming video. <strong>loc</strong> 271</li>
<li>They all shared the scars of damaged dignity. <strong>loc</strong> 294</li>

<li><p>Why You Should Care <strong>loc</strong> 318</p>

<ul>
<li>They are a connected generation, and by reading their stories, you are connected to them too. <strong>loc</strong> 323</li>
<li>Their voices together culminate in a call for contesting political, religious, and conventional authority. Yet perhaps the most revolutionary of their demands is for the principle that undergirds democracy everywhere: for karama, dignity. <strong>loc</strong> 330</li>

<li><p>A Young Man’s Spark (Bouazizi) by Anas Canon <strong>loc</strong> 337</p>

<li>He serves as the artistic director and executive producer for the independent media collective Remarkable Current, which he founded in 2001. <strong>loc</strong> 342</li>

<li><p>Another Flight by Maryam Al Khawaja <strong>loc</strong> 576  Note: is this who i saw speak?</p>

<ul>
<li>“Do not hate people, hate actions.” <strong>loc</strong> 636</li>
<li>The refusal of some people to come out from their comfort zones to demand dignity and to be seen as citizens rather than subjects—or if they choose not to then to at least respect those who do—is beyond me. Unfortunately, the double standard of those who say they want democracy then stand against those who fight for it is not limited to Bahrain. <strong>loc</strong> 680   Note: indeed<br></li>
<li>It is obvious to me through my work around the world that there is a clear double standard when dealing with the so-called Arab Spring—as the West has come to call it. Some politicians are honest and straightforward and tell me that Bahrain is different because it is in the Gulf, home of oil and strategic allies to the world’s superpowers. Whereas Libya has received a direct intervention to save its people from a ruthless dictator, Bahrain receives another type of intervention: Gulf Cooperation Council troops entering the country to help quell the protests. <strong>loc</strong> 683</li>
<li>There are different ways to cope with the stress and insanity of dealing with such a situation. You keep yourself busy. God knows there’s always enough to do. You make sure you do not go to bed unless you are extremely exhausted so your mind has no time to wander. You do not deal with cases as if they are people you know and love, but rather as if they were all mere strangers, none more important to you than another. Sitting on planes, where you have no Internet access, you either write or <strong>loc</strong> 690   Note: cost of caring?</li>
<li>Your work trumps all else because the stakes are too high. Your life is not yours anymore. <strong>loc</strong> 704  Note: the trade-off</li>
<li>they call it the arabspring they beautify the bloodshed the spilt brains the torture the arrests spring people losing their arms spring people shot in the chest spring people electrocuted in their ears spring people with their jaws broken spring if this is spring what will winter be like? <strong>loc</strong> 708   Note: try to contact maryam. use this in intro?</li>
<li>The Bahraini regime treats the country like a family business. People living inside Bahrain are their subjects, not citizens, and everyone works for the family. <strong>loc</strong> 721</li>
<li>people are reclaiming their dignity and their God-given rights as individuals, as humans. <strong>loc</strong> 725</li>
<li>“SuShiBH,” <strong>loc</strong> 732</li>
<li>The threat of sectarian violence exploding in the streets is very real because the government is pushing for it to happen. <strong>loc</strong> 733   Note: divude and conquer</li>
<li>Bahrain at one point had around 300,000 people coming out to protest, almost 50 percent of the population. This is like saying 40 million Egyptians came out to protest against Mubarak. Per capita, we have the second highest number of deaths, and the highest number of detainees. Why is the dire urgency of a situation dependent on how many people have been killed? Is one life lost not one life too many? You admire my friend from Libya for carrying a gun to fight for his freedom, yet I have to explain to you why you should support a people who, even after eight months of an extremely violent crackdown, after a campaign of terrorism led by the regime, are still for the most part peaceful. <strong>loc</strong> 754    Note: our double standards</li>
<li>I wish we lived in a world in which the people deciding on international policies, and the people committing crimes against others, had to face their victims every day. <strong>loc</strong> 767   Note: damn</li>
<li>The governments will continue to try and silence people. In Syria, Yemen, Egypt, and Bahrain, they will continue to torture, detain, use excessive force, and kill, as long as the people and political leaders of this world choose to stay silent. They will continue to kill their citizens until Western governments realize that their real interest lies in countries with real democracies, not authoritarian regimes. Until they realize that the best way to create stability is by including people and treating them like citizens, not by silencing them and tying their hands to provide a fake calm in the country. <strong>loc</strong> 780   Note: the cost of silence</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Flying into a Revolution by Abubakr Al-Shamahi <strong>loc</strong> 797</p>

<ul>
<li>Received wisdom tells us that the rich are comfortable and do not welcome the instability that a revolution would bring, and the poor are more concerned with putting food on the table than changing the government. <strong>loc</strong> 836   Note: seems right</li>
<li>ash-sha‘ab yureed isqat an-nizam (The people want to bring down the regime). <strong>loc</strong> 842</li>
<li>Taghyir Square—Change Square. <strong>loc</strong> 845</li>
<li>I understood the grievances of the anti-Saleh protesters. I wanted true democracy in Yemen. I wanted an end to the corruption and poverty that accompanied this regime. But I hadn’t lived that. <strong>loc</strong> 860   Note: plight of the spectator</li>
<li>a revolution certainly changes your opinions. <strong>loc</strong> 896</li>
<li>they chanted as the bullets whizzed around: silmiya, silmiya, silmiya miya miya (Peaceful, peaceful, we will remain peaceful). <strong>loc</strong> 962</li>
<li>I also felt newfound pride in my Arab identity. From Tunisia to Egypt to Libya to Syria to Bahrain to Yemen, Arabs, including all those in the rest of the world who have spoken out, were breaking the fear barrier that has prevented the general populace from speaking out against their regimes. <strong>loc</strong> 1015</li>
<li>But in reality, with the great educator that is Change Square, things can never go back to the way they were. They must change for the better. As the banner said: Welcome to the first kilometer of dignity. <strong>loc</strong> 1020</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>From Nowhere to Somewhere by Dina Sadek <strong>loc</strong> 1024</p>

<ul>
<li>All I wanted was to live somewhere where I was treated as a human being, where I could articulate my opinions without being scared for my life. I wanted to get a decent education and a job that would actually pay for my rent. I wanted to have a life. I believed it was my right as a human being—and how strange a phrase this was to utter in Egypt! <strong>loc</strong> 1061</li>
<li>The stories about everything being planned and organized are inaccurate. When I went there, I saw people who were just as lost as I was, not only in the square but also in life in general. <strong>loc</strong> 1072</li>
<li>When a stone hit my back, I realized right then that “this is really happening.” It was us versus them, protesters versus the regime forces, and I picked up the next stone I found and threw it as hard as my small self could manage. I was bleeding from what I later realized was a tiny injury. I was in pain, but I understood at that moment that it did not matter. I had been punched metaphorically every day of my entire life by my country’s unjust regime, which had never even once treated me, or anybody for that matter, as a human being. <strong>loc</strong> 1082</li>
<li>I am never going to forget the face of an older man in his sixties who was standing in the square. He was checking on a young man who had a bandage on his head due to being injured by a stone. The old man cried and apologized to the young protester, “I am sorry, I am really sorry you have to go through this now. If only my generation had been brave enough to do this a long time ago, you wouldn’t have to go through this now.” <strong>loc</strong> 1090</li>
<li>The power of the chants was indescribable—empowering yet surreal at the same time. After years and years of not being able to speak out, I was suddenly standing in a public square yelling at the top of my voice until my throat became sore. <strong>loc</strong> 1093 Note: power of a voice</li>
<li>The determination of protesters that day was shown by how prepared they came. Some brought cases of surgical masks and handed them out to protesters. Others followed advice from Tunisians, who had posted on Facebook and Twitter after suffering through similar experiences involving tear gas. They advised us to wash our faces with soda or smell an onion should we be tear-gassed. Some brought cans of soda and bags filled with onions and rushed towards people hit by the gas to help them. <strong>loc</strong> 1122</li>
<li>One of the most popular slogans was irhal meaning “leave,” following the Tunisians, who had held signs saying “dégage,” meaning “leave” in French. Another popular chanted slogan was ash-sha‘ab yureed isqat an-nizam! (The people demand the removal of the regime). <strong>loc</strong> 1128</li>
<li>It was not only news of the violence of the regime’s forces that incentivized people on that day. Friday the 28th marked the date of one of the stupidest decisions in the history of the Mubarak regime: to cut cell phone and Internet connectivity. Taking Internet access away from youth is like putting a fish on dry land, except that a fish would be helpless to do anything constructive with its anger. Even if I were an apathetic young person who could not care less about the political protests, if you took away something vital to my daily life I would go out and protest against that. Many people joined the protests that day only because when Internet and phones were cut off they could not find out what was going on any other way. And once they felt the power of freedom even for a minute, they could not go back. <strong>loc</strong> 1132 Note: shutting down the internet backfires</li>
<li>The protest was not just a cry for the redress of socio-economic grievances, as the regime’s PR machine made it sound. For many, it wasn’t about the money. They were angry that they had never been able to choose their president and their government, or to express their objections about anything. Now they finally had a voice to do so. <strong>loc</strong> 1179</li>
<li>Everyone was elated and the chant irfaa rasak fo‘a anta masri (Hold your head up high, you are Egyptian) rang out through the streets of Egypt. <strong>loc</strong> 1184</li>
<li>Egyptians have a long way to go, from learning about freedom and democracy to actually implementing it in their society. Seeing how people react to politics, it’s clear that they haven’t been a part of it for years, which is one more reason to despise the former regime. <strong>loc</strong> 1209</li>
<li>Living in Egypt is now a choice, and I choose it every day. <strong>loc</strong> 1216</li>

<li>“Will” was not something I believed existed in Syria. <strong>loc</strong> 1267</li>
<li>was not used to being silent and my independent outbursts of frustration were usually met with someone telling me to shut my mouth or we would “vanish.” While some might have considered such a reaction an insult, close friends and family would always stress to me that this was just an ugly reality we all had to accept. <strong>loc</strong> 1272</li>
<li>“The moment I chanted freedom was the moment I’d found my dignity.” <strong>loc</strong> 1326</li>
<li>And even though I had grown up in a free country, I too felt like I had tasted freedom for the first time and couldn’t believe how on earth someone could live without it. <strong>loc</strong> 1340</li>
<li>So was it all worth it? The question persists. The answer is simple, but asking was selfish. <strong>loc</strong> 1365</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Live-Tweeting a Revolution by Sultan Al Qassemi <strong>loc</strong> 1369</p>

<ul>
<li>The fate of Arabs couldn’t be to forever live under oppressive regimes, and it shouldn’t be. The Arab uprisings started from none other than Tunisia, one of the worst police states and the seat of the Arab Council of Arab Interior Ministers, who are responsible for monitoring their populations. It was ironic, but it was also very fitting. The collapse of the Tunisian regime was a message to all Arab dictators that sooner or later, no matter how hard they tried to oppress their populations, they would not be able to stand in the face of destiny. <strong>loc</strong> 1379</li>
<li>Like millions of young Arabs, I was fortunate to be part of this phenomenon, mainly through the wonders of technology. <strong>loc</strong> 1384</li>
<li>The day before Bouazizi died, I wrote my last article for The National in Abu Dhabi.1 It began with the following: “The Arabs are a patient lot. Twenty years after a wave of democracy swept through Eastern Europe, Arabs are still waiting for their own wave. In the past few weeks a series of setbacks have pushed their dreams even further away. They haven’t lost hope though, as the latest protests in Tunisia have demonstrated.” <strong>loc</strong> 1388</li>
<li>When Bouazizi died the next day, it was clear to me that this would be a monumental event that would not go unnoticed. I tweeted “Avenue Mohammed Bouazizi 1986–2011.” A few weeks after Ben Ali was toppled, the authorities did in fact name a road after Bouazizi. <strong>loc</strong> 1393</li>
<li>emancipation movement. <strong>loc</strong> 1420 Note: better than arab spring?</li>
<li>The protest on January 25th was the most dignified I have ever seen. In order to bypass the draconian martial law imposed almost throughout Egypt’s military dictatorships since the 1950s and avoid persecution, intelligent Egyptians made sure not to chant or gather in large groups. As I have noted in openDemocracy, at this protest the people knew why they were there and so did everybody else. <strong>loc</strong> 1426</li>
<li>A momentum was swelling, one that translated into more and more people joining the ash-shaheed (martyr) page (as the “We are all Khaled Said” Facebook page has become known in Arabic). <strong>loc</strong> 1429</li>
<li>When #Jan25 (as the uprising was called on Twitter) started, it was my chance to take part. I knew then, in my gut, that this was no ordinary protest, this was no ordinary country, these were no ordinary people. <strong>loc</strong> 1440</li>
<li>When Habib A. Adly, Egypt’s despised Interior Minister, withdrew the police from the streets, it was announced live on TV, and in the crucial minutes after the announcement, the dissemination of this information to the people meant the difference between safety and danger. <strong>loc</strong> 1456</li>
<li>Some people have long assumed that those of us who come from the Gulf are not sympathetic to political progress, to reform or to change. But this was our chance, too. <strong>loc</strong> 1464</li>
<li>Today, for us in the Gulf, it is crucial for the Egyptian uprising to be completed and finally turned into a revolution—for the leadership to change, the laws to change, the mentality of those governing to change. Egyptians, Arabs, and the rest of the world must remain optimistic. <strong>loc</strong> 1488</li>
<li>If Egypt succeeds we will have a new standard of freedom to emulate. We can show those in the Gulf that Islam and freedom can co-exist, that the choice need not be either authoritarianism or chaos. But for all of us to succeed, Egypt—the mother of the world, as it is referred to in Arabic—must succeed first. Egypt the country, Egypt the people, Egypt the idea. <strong>loc</strong> 1492</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A Journey to Activism by Yasmin Haloui <strong>loc</strong> 1509</p>

<ul>
<li>Democracy was to them an illusion, unattainable. According to some, the counts had already been made. They assumed the imperialist and colonialist super powers had already decided who was going to be president. The new leaders would merely become new dictators. <strong>loc</strong> 1558</li>
<li>The revolution had transformed a nation from silent observers and objects of oppression into active subjects of change. The main tool of this transformation was social media, mainly Facebook. <strong>loc</strong> 1585</li>
<li>The reality of revolution, as I lived it, was not fundamental change, as many politicians and academics seemed to believe. If it was, then Tunisia had experienced only a partial revolution. Living in Holland, far from Tunisia, had given me a mythical perception of the revolution. But seeing the soldier standing by the plane had pulled me into reality. Freedom came with a price: death, blood, violence, and insecurity. <strong>loc</strong> 1599</li>
<li>Pieces of the newly framed reality fell into old, existing patterns. Old conflicts lingered and hidden ones came to the surface. New division lines intertwined with past ones to change yet at the same time continue the socio-political relations and reality of life in a small town such as Hammamet. <strong>loc</strong> 1604</li>
<li>Hammamet appeared to already have two constituencies for the protection of the revolution: one dominated by secularists and one dominated by Islamists. I simply had to choose a group; I had to choose my side. We had inherited the struggles of the past. The struggle between Islamists and secularists that had taken place in the ’70s and ’80s, which had been resolved through dictatorial measures, reappeared after the revolution. <strong>loc</strong> 1631</li>
<li>We inherited the words, the descriptions, and the language of hate of our fathers, professors, and peers. This language was increasingly present in political speeches and in local politicized meetings. We were in a crisis of framing. And the organization of socio-political life in the post-revolution period was pressuring us into choosing sides. <strong>loc</strong> 1635</li>
<li>The fear was being translated in increasingly intensifying hate speech. <strong>loc</strong> 1646</li>
<li>Violence has to be imagined before it is enacted, and this hate speech was imagined violence. Physical violence was the next step. We had to act. <strong>loc</strong> 1647</li>
<li>The continuing struggle to change the language and representation of the Other within the members of the group itself, as well as retractions from those who had offered help with the conference, culminated in the annulment of the conference. We failed. In the upcoming months, tension grew between what were now socio-political groups in Tunisia. <strong>loc</strong> 1654</li>
<li>A politician would say that the deaths of the martyrs should not be pointless, and as such we should all vote for his party. But this apparent sincerity was merely a performance, a reflection of the nationalist discourse as it is used worldwide. These were empty words, since almost no politician cared to tackle the charge of impunity, to discuss police reform, justice, or reconciliation. <strong>loc</strong> 1664</li>
<li>While politicians sought a way to gain seats in the government at the upcoming elections, food prices rose and unemployment spread wider—yet politicians remained silent. “All they want are the seats,” people frequently remarked when talking about politicians. Many added, “We are headed into a wall.” Sit-ins by workers at factories gave voice to their social demands but conflicted with their economic needs. <strong>loc</strong> 1669</li>
<li>A few days before the elections on October 23, a video was shared on Facebook. An immense picture of Ben Ali was hanging on a wall in Tunis. People passed by, looked at the picture, and wondered what this meant. A group of men approached the picture and decided to take it down. As they did, another statement appeared on the second layer: “Dictatorship can come back, so go vote.” It was part of a campaign to raise awareness about the necessity of voting. <strong>loc</strong> 1672 Note: wow</li>
<li>Elections took place on Sunday October 23, and Nahda won the elections. <strong>loc</strong> 1676</li>
<li>At voting centers people had been either paid or ordered to vote for such and such party. Some voting centers had been organized in such a way that all its personnel belonged to one political party, and with this particular loss of neutrality came scandalous transgressions of the voting process. <strong>loc</strong> 1678</li>
<li>After our rather spontaneous intifada and people’s revolution, resistance needed to be organized and remain a people’s resistance. <strong>loc</strong> 1686</li>
<li>Nahda was the now ruling party, and as with the old CDR party, people feared criticizing it. Stories of intimidation and threats followed. Fear was becoming more present. <strong>loc</strong> 1691</li>
<li>“We are all the sons of Ben Ali. We are all little dictators in our own worlds, our own regimes. We believe we have the right to tell people what to say and what not to. Becoming democrats, real ones, will be the only way to beat this system. Otherwise, we are only replacing the old system with the same system but new power holders, ones that will reproduce the dictatorship in more or less extreme ways. But it always remains a dictatorship.” <strong>loc</strong> 1699 Note: strong warning message</li>
<li>The revolution was the outburst of an anti-movement, but then the storm calmed down and normalcy took over again. The revolution became part of the system instead of remaining a power outside of it that could defy, challenge, and ultimately change it. Politicians took over. Old discourses ignited from within the old corrupt system framed the everyday, and in the name of our revolution, we Tunisians were now protecting what, months ago, we were fighting. <strong>loc</strong> 1704</li>
<li>The positive aspect of what could be otherwise interpreted as a sad end is that those who are fighting the corrupt system are back at the margins, where every revolution starts. <strong>loc</strong> 1708</li>

<li><p>Egypt to Libya: Arab Solidarity 2.0 by Adel Abdel Ghafar <strong>loc</strong> 1712</p>

<ul>
<li>@dooolism. <strong>loc</strong> 1721</li>
<li>Libyans, inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt, started demanding their freedom from Moammar Gadhafi. Not one exactly known for his compromising skills, Gadhafi responded by unleashing his forces on the general population. <strong>loc</strong> 1732</li>
<li>Emboldened by the downfall of Ben Ali in Tunisia, and long suffering from political, economic, and social injustices, the Egyptian people had said simply: no more. <strong>loc</strong> 1737</li>
<li>Libya was not just another Arab country going through an uprising. The cultural, historical, economic, and social ties between Egypt and Libya run deep. <strong>loc</strong> 1752</li>
<li>Matkhafsh, yeb’alak ashshay, which translates literally to: “Don’t worry, you will have your tea.” It’s effectively the Egyptian code phrase for “We will grease your pocket with a bribe.” <strong>loc</strong> 1819</li>
<li>Misr wa Libya, eed wahda! (Egypt and Libya are one hand). <strong>loc</strong> 1840</li>
<li>Every time I attempt to pay for food, drink, or accommodation, the Libyans refuse our money, their small gesture of thanks for the convoy. To me it is a profound moment of Arab solidarity in action; complete strangers from across borders caring and helping each other as fellow Arabs locked in conflict with our own repressive and brutal despots. <strong>loc</strong> 1845</li>
<li>Mohammed, our Libyan guide, tells us that in the days of battle in Benghazi, Gadhafi loyalists eventually retreated to this fortified compound, called Al Kateeba, meaning “the squad” in Arabic. The revolutionaries had tried to breach it several times, but the gate was too thick to break through. They decided that the only solution was a suicide mission to blow the gate apart. Many revolutionaries put their name forward to have this honor, and ultimately Mahdy Zeyo, a forty-nine-year old bespectacled man, was chosen. <strong>loc</strong> 1898</li>
<li>On the walls of the compound, beside the mangled remains of the green gate, two lists are written in black paint: One is Qaa’emat al omalaa (the list of traitors) with the names of Gadhafi’s henchmen who had fought inside this compound. The other list, a much larger one, is called Qaa’emat ash-shuhadaa (list of martyrs) and has the names of all the freedom fighters that had died storming this compound. <strong>loc</strong> 1908</li>
<li>Even though the times have changed since the heyday of Arab nationalism, it’s clear that Arab solidarity is alive and well—perhaps not between the presidents, emirs and kings, but certainly between the everyday Arab people. The saying goes, “If America sneezes, the world catches a cold.” Perhaps one day we will say, “If Egypt is liberated, the whole Arab world will follow suit.” <strong>loc</strong> 1947</li>
<li>Mahdy Zeyo is now revered in Benghazi. His story was covered by the Washington Post, New York Times and The Guardian globally. A short documentary titled ‘We Win, or We Die(Slam Dance Cut)’ on You Tube explains the events of that day, and gives some background on Zeyo. <strong>loc</strong> 1955</li>

<li>Achref founded I WATCH, a Tunisian watch-dog organization working on transparency, good governance, and anti-corruption. I WATCH conducted the largest domestic observation mission in Tunisia’s last elections. <strong>loc</strong> 1967</li>
<li>We talk about the Tunisian revolution as if it started on December 17, 2010, the day when Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire, or else on the fateful day January 14, 2011, when Ben Ali fled Tunisia. But the real flames of the revolution were kindled in 2008 by the youth of Rdayef in the Mine Region. The fight for dignity started then and there. Why am I talking about this? I want to tell those who underestimate the power of social media and cyber activists: dictators are, in fact, aware of such a hidden power. <strong>loc</strong> 1974</li>
<li>In 2008, when the uprising started in Rdayef, a town in the governorate of Gafsa, the government censored Facebook for more than three months, and also censored YouTube, Flicker, and Dailymotion. <strong>loc</strong> 1978</li>
<li>Drawing a comparison between the Tunisian uprisings of 2008 and 2011, one wonders why the former failed while the latter moved from a mere uprising to a revolution that paved the way for many other Arab revolutions. What is the difference between the two? In 2008, social media sites were censored. In 2011, social media was present. <strong>loc</strong> 1980</li>
<li>Do you know what it is like to be in the same country where your brothers and sisters are suffering and not be able to share their pain? <strong>loc</strong> 1986</li>
<li>But people should know that behind the mask of tolerance and democracy that the government has promoted there is an established dictatorship. Behind the five-star hotels there are the “for bread only”1 people. Behind the sunset there is no hope. My peers go to the beach not to swim but to emigrate to Europe in the middle of the night. Between the lines of the government’s pompous slogans exists a bitter tragedy. <strong>loc</strong> 2004</li>
<li>My frustration dated back to the first time I ever lowered my voice to talk about the president. I instantly started remembering all those moments of political programming: the moment you are asked to change the topic every time you attempt to tackle a political issue, the moment you are taught not to trust your neighbor because you suspect him of being a secret agent, the moment you stop going to the mosque lest you face the same brutal fate as the Islamists did in the beginning of the 1990s. <strong>loc</strong> 2029</li>
<li>It takes a particular sentiment to produce something for public consumption—embracing the fact that that my ideas would no longer remain imprisoned within the very limited space of my brain and that “the whole world” would read them. <strong>loc</strong> 2036</li>
<li>In Tunisia, 404 stood for censorship. Every time one would type the name of a political website or try to search for data forbidden to the general public, the famous “ERROR 404” would appear on the screen, announcing that “big brother” had caught you red-handed. In response, a group of young cyber activists, to whom I did not belong but whom I admired, launched an anti-censorship campaign under the name “Salah 404.” <strong>loc</strong> 2048</li>
<li>If a Tunisian used the word “Salah,” he or she would probably be referring to internet censorship. Their campaign quickly ended, though, as any other anti-government activity usually does, with the same outcome: police troops chasing the activists. <strong>loc</strong> 2051</li>
<li>The death in 2010 of Khaled Said, a blogger beaten to death in public by two Egyptian police officers while he was in a cyber café, influenced my writings greatly; I became more daring, dire, direct, and sincere. I realized that living in Tunisia and living in Egypt meant the same thing: that being a young man here or there was not that different. It was the same dictatorship, the same struggle for dignity and for FREEDOM. <strong>loc</strong> 2056</li>
<li>Each time we trusted someone or believed in him, he disappointed us. Each time we believed in the opposition’s message and promises to us, we soon discovered that they only cared about their own interests. Each time we trusted the so-called intelligentsia we discovered that they pandered to instead of opposed the government. Even in this most recent revolution the opposition disappointed us. The army gave up on us after the revolution, as they did in Egypt. <strong>loc</strong> 2081</li>
<li>The implications were great: if you bothered the government, it meant that you were just and truthful. <strong>loc</strong> 2098</li>
<li>What the Western world would eventually call “the Arab Spring,” and what I call a battle for freedom and dignity, started in my country, Tunisia. It all started with a street vendor setting his body on fire on December 17, 2010. When Bouazizi set fire to his body, I could not help but resume blogging. With each kid who was killed, the will to blog increased. I needed to write something for the people and for my country and for myself. <strong>loc</strong> 2113</li>
<li>Blogging in its traditional form almost vanished during the revolution. It was re-imagined as a medium for sharing videos shot by citizen journalists and as a platform for providing the masses with the latest news. In other words, bloggers became citizen journalists. <strong>loc</strong> 2121</li>
<li>Personally, I still believe that Twitter is “elitist” in Tunisia. Only bloggers and activists are on Twitter, so if you tweet, you target a limited though cultivated group of people. The common Tunisian is on Facebook. <strong>loc</strong> 2123</li>
<li>After the revolution, I did not resume blogging. Tunisia after the revolution, in my view, needed people in the field more than behind their laptops. It needed people to leave the screen and the big cities to go to the Tunisian-Libyan border’s refugee camps and to internal regions like Sidi Bouzid, Kasserine, Kef, Gbeli, Gafsa, and Jendouba. It needed people to listen to other people’s suffering. It needed people to go once again into the streets to deter any endeavor to “steal” the revolution from us, the organizers of the revolution, and drag us into another dictatorship. <strong>loc</strong> 2126</li>
<li>For most of the world, February 14 is Valentine’s Day. But in 2011 for Tunisians, it meant a month since our revolution, a month of freedom, a month without Ben Ali. Thus, I created an event on Facebook asking Tunisians, instead of celebrating Valentine’s Day, to celebrate our freedom and show love for our country. <strong>loc</strong> 2136</li>

The men on motorcycles transporting the wounded from dangerous zones to hospitals, the mothers who lost their children, the journalists who risked their lives covering the news, and the nurses who worked endlessly to help the wounded.

<li>It was just eight months ago when Egyptians overcame fear, protested in the millions in this very square, and toppled their stubborn pharaoh. But today, in the face of another tragedy, it was barren and lifeless. In my head, I cursed those who had instilled fear in the hearts of Egyptians once again. <strong>loc</strong> 2661</li>
<li>on October 9, 2011, and only a couple of kilometers from Tahrir, the blood of Coptic (Egyptian Orthodox Christians) protesters was spilled at the doorsteps of the Egyptian radio and television building known as Maspero. <strong>loc</strong> 2688</li>
<li>In just eight months, Egypt had witnessed more attacks against Christians than any period in recent memory, and virtually all of these seemed unprovoked and not in line with popular public sentiments. It seemed like someone was trying to sow seeds of hate between Egyptians. <strong>loc</strong> 2692</li>
<li>During the eighteen days of protests that toppled Mubarak, Christians stood hand-in-hand around their Muslim brethren to protect them during their prayers from the attacks of pro-Mubarak mobs. They would raise their hands to reveal their cross tattoos. It was a sign of interfaith solidarity. But on October 9, these same tattoos turned into targets of reprisal. Egypt after Mubarak, it seemed, had descended to a new <strong>loc</strong> 2717</li>
<li>At no point in the Mubarak era had anything this vile and grotesque occurred, not even when the regime was fighting for its last breaths. The delicate balance of Egypt’s religious diversity had been disrupted. No one knew what this meant or what could be done to rectify the situation. The whole country seemed to have frozen in time. <strong>loc</strong> 2723</li>
<li>While two dates, January 25 and February 11, both etched their mark in the Egyptian calendar in 2011—the first for the first eruption of the revolution and the second for the toppling of Mubarak—that was also a year of near daily sacrifice and bloodshed. And October 9 of that year, some eight months after Mubarak’s fall, has become another unforgettable day in modern Egyptian history. On that day, the political fault lines in Egypt were redrawn, and the revolution was re-ignited. <strong>loc</strong> 2760</li>
<li>So although the Copts were facing the same predicaments as all Egyptians, as a minority with “special status,” they had been indoctrinated to believe that being a spectator to events guarantees self-preservation. <strong>loc</strong> 2771</li>
<li>When Mubarak was finally toppled, the country rejoiced as one—Muslim and Christian. <strong>loc</strong> 2781</li>
<li>bolder. The state, now under military rule, tried to counter this by describing all further demands as “factional” protests, arguing they were divisive rather than being in the whole nation’s best interests. <strong>loc</strong> 2784</li>
<li>The great Egyptian revolution that the world had rejoiced in, that inspired similar movements in the region and beyond, that world leaders had raced to commemorate, had died before my eyes. I was subconsciously mourning not only the lives of those lost in this carnage but also the innocence of a once-utopian revolution. <strong>loc</strong> 2811</li>
<li>The ruling military junta had set a historic precedent and killed its own people in cold blood. They counted on the Muslim majority to overlook the massacre and support the military by condemning their Christian countrymen and women. But they had miscalculated. Their foolish barbarism had stripped Mubarak’s military of its camouflage, added to the ranks of the revolution’s martyrs, and turned that young Christian man, Mina Danial, into the new Khaled Said. <strong>loc</strong> 2818</li>
<li>For months and years to come, the chant Iqtil Khaled, Iqtil Mina, kul rosasa betkaweena (Kill Khaled. Kill Mina. Every bullet strengthens us!) would be a rallying cry for unity between Muslims and Christians against tyranny. <strong>loc</strong> 2822</li>
<li>When Egypt’s military rulers inherited power from Mubarak, many hoped they would be the benevolent force that would shepherd the country towards democracy. But SCAF has dashed these hopes. Instead, they have taken pages out of Mubarak’s playbook and used religion to drive a wedge between Muslims and Christians in the country. And in instances like the Maspero massacre, they have surpassed their predecessor in both brutality and impunity. <strong>loc</strong> 2828</li>
<li>Egyptians often say that the worst criminal is “he who kills someone and walks in their funeral.” On the first Coptic Christmas after the Maspero massacre, SCAF did just this. General Hamdi Badeen, the man who oversaw the conduct of the military police on that bloody night, sat in the front row of the mass and, smiling, shook hands with Coptic Pope Shenouda to congratulate Egypt’s Christians. <strong>loc</strong> 2834</li>
<li>Although they are soldiers, they have lost sight of how to defend our honor and dignity. When they killed us at Maspero, and in subsequent incidents at Mohammed Mahmoud Street, at the Cabinet sit-in, at the Port Said soccer massacre, and elsewhere, they repeated Mubarak’s mistakes. By killing us in the name of stabilizing the country, they have broken the delicate social contract with us, the people. <strong>loc</strong> 2846</li>

<li>On January 25, I was twenty-three, and I will always remember it as the day my life fundamentally changed. I owe so much to this day. It gave me life, it gave me a sense of ownership over the physical and figurative space my body occupies.

<li>On February 11 we all felt victorious when former President Hosni Mubarak stepped down and the army took our side, pledging to protect the people. “The military and the people, hand in hand,” we had chanted.

<li>We are tweeting endlessly, posting on Facebook about what is going on, translating news and videos from Arabic into English and other languages as activists and volunteers. <strong>loc</strong> 3901</li>
<li>The Coordinations spread horizontally because a hierarchical structure is subject to breach by Syrian regime, no one can be fully trusted, either because a member could be an informant, or an arrested member might break down and talk about their work and individuals working with them. There was also the problem of communications between different groups because everything was monitored. The horizontal structure of the Coordinations made them all equal. <strong>loc</strong> 3920 Note: horizontal org</li>

<li>Arming the people was not a choice that Syrians took willingly. They remained peaceful for months while all kinds of weapons were used on them. We are all aware of the negative effect of the spread of arms, but this was an action of self-defense. <strong>loc</strong> 3959</li>
<li>Our revolution is not composed of a certain religious group or ethnicity, it is a comprehensive revolution that Syrians from different backgrounds and beliefs have participated in.
