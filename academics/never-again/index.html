<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Actions may speak louder than words, but sometimes words (or the lack thereof) are equally as poignant. The word “genocide” is one that weighs heavily on the human conscience. It carries with it the guilt of past atrocities committed against fellow mankind and a promise to ourselves that we will not allow it to happen again. Realistically, though, genocide has occurred more than once. It continues to occur in modern society, and the media connects us to such atrocities more effectively than ever before.</p>

<p>Though they weren’t alone in their inaction, the United States’ response to signs of genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda in the 1990s were inconsistent with the promise to never again allow the horror of genocide to spread. The United States government’s words and its actions left much to interpretation by those involved in the atrocities as well as those on the outside looking in. A study of the language used in regard to these tragedies as well as the forms and the duration of aid provided expose patterns in US foreign policy toward the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides.</p>

<h2 id="rwanda">Rwanda</h2>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>The class structure of the Tutsi elite minority and the Hutu majority was established and reinforced by the German and Belgian governments in the early 1900s, and this was likely the start of the ethnic rivalry that was to come to a head in the 1990s. Hutus rebelled against the established Tutsi elite in 1959 and took power over the government by 1962. From this point on, affronts on the Tutsis occurred within Rwanda, pushing most of the Tutsi population out of Rwanda and actively restricting or excluding those who remained from participation in government functions throughout the 1970s and 1980s <a href="#rwanda">(“Rwanda Chronology,” 2013)</a>.</p>

<p>By 1986, exiled Tutsis from Rwanda participated in the overthrow of Ugandan dictator Milton Obote and formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). These united forces invaded Rwanda in 1990 <a href="#goose">(Goose &amp; Smyth, 1994, p. 88)</a> and war between the Rwandan army and the RPF continued until a cease-fire in March of 1991, which included a promise to establish a multi-party system that would respect Hutus and Tutsis alike. Contrary to this agreement, Tutsis continued to be murdered throughout the country and hateful rhetoric encouraging Hutus to send the Tutsis “back to Ethiopia” via the rivers spread.</p>

<p>In August of 1993, the UN deployed troops to ensure the implementation of a peace accord that would establish a timeframe for the return of refugees as well as the creation of a joint Hutu-RPF government, but this process was stalled into 1994. During this delay, Hutu militias continued to train, and rhetoric encouraging the extermination of Tutsis escalated, disseminating its message of hate via radio waves.</p>

<p>On April 6, 1994, Hutu President Habyarimana’s plane was allegedly shot down by extremists that suspected the president was on his way to finally formalize the peace accords started in 1991 <a href="#moose1994">(Moose &amp; Harper, 1994, p. 3)</a>. The mass killings of Tutsis as well as moderate Hutu politicians by Hutu forces began that evening while UN troops, charged only with monitoring the situation, failed to intervene. The RPF responded in reaction to the mass slaughter of Tutsis with significant force. Two weeks later, as the violence escalated, the UN reduced its presence by 90 percent, leaving only a few hundred remaining in the country <a href="#crisis">(“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 67)</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of April, over a quarter of a million Rwandans had fled the country and the UN Security Council began to discuss their approach to the crisis. It wasn’t until May 17, 1994, that the UN used the word “genocide” to describe the crisis in Rwanda. UN-backed troops were not deployed to Rwanda until July of 1994. By this time, over 600,000 Rwandans had been killed <a href="#crisis">(“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 45)</a>, and the murder of both Hutus and Tutsis continued within the country and in refugee camps even after UN forces arrived.</p>

<p>In February of 1995, financial commitments were made, but tension increased between the Rwandan government and the UN over a lack of delivery on the promised international aid. The Rwandan government requested in June of 1995 that the UN withdraw their troops; the UN Security Council cut their troop presence by over half. Though a tribunal was established in November of 1994, the first case in the Rwandan genocide trials did not begin until January of 1997; they have continued in the years since <a href="#rwanda">(“Rwanda Chronology,” 2013)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="united-states-aid-and-involvement">United States Aid and Involvement</h3>
<p>President Clinton released a statement on April 7, 1994, expressing his shock and grief over the death of the Rwandan president. He strongly condemned the violence that followed and called on the warring parties to cease “such actions” immediately <a href="#clinton1994">(Clinton, 1994)</a>. Four days later, a private memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle East/Africa to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy identified that the government was unwilling to get involved inside of Rwanda until peace was restored and that they planned to restart their security assistance program once that occurred. In the meantime, the State planned to limit its involvement in the Rwandan conflict to statements in support of the UN, France, and Belgium’s efforts to resume the peace process. They acknowledged internally that a “massive bloodbath” would likely occur if peace talks were not resumed <a href="#usds">(“Cable number 099440, to US Mission to the United Nations, New York. ‘Talking Points for UNAMIR Withdrawal,’” 1994, pp. 2-3)</a>.</p>

<p>By the 15th of April, the US Department of State had instructed US diplomats to encourage the withdrawal of all United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) presence from the country, offering that “experience suggests that any serious negotiations among the parties will take place outside Rwanda; therefore, UN Security Forces will not be required” <a href="#usds">(“Cable number 099440, to US Mission to the United Nations, New York. ‘Talking Points for UNAMIR Withdrawal,’” 1994, p. 4)</a>. However, on May 1st, discussion points made by the Department of Defense identified that great care was being taken not to refer to the escalating violence in Rwanda as a “genocide,” since such a “finding could commit USG [United States Government] to actually ‘do something’” <a href="#discussion">(“Discussion Paper,” 1994, p. 1)</a>. Within the same discussion points, it was acknowledged that the “present force does not have the manpower or equipment” to protect refugees and that there was “no support at present for increasing either the size or equipment of the UN PKO [Peacekeeping Operations] force” <a href="#discussion">(“Discussion Paper,” 1994, p. 2)</a>. Finally, regarding the US embargo on Rwanda, this document noted in bold that they did not “envision it will have a significant impact on the killings because machetes, knives and other hand implements have been the most common weapons” <a href="#discussion">(“Discussion Paper,” 1994, p. 3)</a>.</p>

<p>The United States was involved from the start in the UN Security council discussions regarding the Rwandan crisis and contributed troops and funds to the effort. Despite the fact that the UN deemed the crisis in Rwanda to be a genocide in May, it wasn’t until June of 1994 that the US government publicly acknowledged the killings as a genocide.</p>

<p>The United States began its humanitarian efforts to Rwandan refugees in August of 1994. US monetary aid allocated to the Rwandan government in 1995 amounted to $60 million, one tenth of the total amount pledged by Western governments <a href="#rwanda">(“Rwanda Chronology,” 2013)</a>. Jeff Drumtra, Africa Policy Analyst for the U.S. Committee for Refugees, criticized these aid efforts in his prepared statement for a Congressional hearing on July 26, 1994, saying that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Average Americans’ unfortunate stereotypes about tribal African wars masked the reality of what was happening in Rwanda and immobilized the public’s response. Public financial contributions to Rwandan relief efforts were meager through June, according to InterAction, the umbrella agency for American relief organizations. The Administration did not communicate the stark, one-sided nature of the killings, or that events in Rwanda represented one of history’s greatest crimes. The Administration did not elevate this crisis to priority status, and thus neither did the public” <a href="#crisis">(“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 68)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="bosnia">Bosnia</h2>

<h3 id="history-1">History</h3>
<p>The region in Europe where Bosnia lies has also had its share of conflict throughout history. Serbs and Croats belonged to different cultural and religious backgrounds associated with eastern orthodoxy and Catholicism, while Bosnia’s religion and culture was strongly influenced by the Ottoman Empire, its inhabitants practicing Islam <a href="#garde">(Garde, 1998)</a>. This resulted in three distinct ethnicities with different national allegiances cohabitating in an area that falls on the dividing line between the eastern and western world.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, Bosnia-Herzegovina became an annex of Austria-Hungary. The assassination of the Austrian archduke, which occurred in Sarajevo, was a critical component to the start of the First World War. During World War II, thousands of Muslims and Bosnians were killed by Croatian fascists allied with the Nazis. Simultaneously, Muslims and Croats were being killed by Serbian nationalists <a href="#garde">(Garde, 1998)</a>. Some semblance of stability was introduced in 1945 when Bosnia became a republic as part of the Yugoslav Socialist Federation. It became apparent over time that the communist regime was the only truly autonomous power in the federation, and it determined which leaders had control within the republics, each representing a different ethnic group <a href="#garde">(Garde, 1998)</a>.</p>

<p>Consequently, the collapse of communism in the Balkan region in the late 1980s resulted in the establishment of a coalition government comprised of parties with distinctly different end goals. Muslims wished for an independent Bosnian state, Croats wished for an independent Croatian state and the Serbs envisioned a unified Yugoslavian territory effectively behaving as a greater Serbian state <a href="#garde">(Garde, 1998)</a>. War broke out in full force after Muslims and Croats proclaimed their independence in 1991. It was at this time that the Serbs began the process of ethnic cleansing–the forced expulsion of undesired ethnic or religious groups by means such as arson, rape and murder–and established the Republika Srpska <a href="#bbc">(“Bosnia-Hercegovina timeline,” 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>By 1993, increased tensions turned Muslims against Croats, further complicating the war inside of Bosnia where alliances between Muslims and Serbs were formed against Croats, and Croats and Serbs against Muslims. It was at this point that the UN established safe havens in Gorazde, Srebrenica and Sarajevo for Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) within the disputed territory of Bosnia <a href="#bbc">(“Bosnia-Hercegovina timeline,” 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>The mass killing of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in the safe haven of Srebrenica, regardless of the UN presence in the area, led to NATO involvement in 1995 and the creation of the Dayton Peace Accord, which was signed by the three warring parties’ leaders. The Accord decreed that the country be split, providing space for the Bosniaks and Croats on one side and the Bosnian Serbs on the other. It also mandated that peacekeeping forces be deployed <a href="#clinton1995">(Clinton, 1995, p. 1777)</a>. Moreover, the UN designated someone to act as High Representative to oversee the country’s implementation of the mandates within the Dayton Peace Accord; this position still functions within Bosnia Herzegovina today <a href="#ohr">(“Ohr Introduction,” 2012)</a>. A tribunal was established in 1996, and the first conviction for war crimes was tried that year. In the years to come, individuals from all three warring parties would be tried and convicted of war crimes <a href="#bbc">(“Bosnia-Hercegovina timeline,” 2012)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="united-states-aid-and-involvement-1">United States Aid and Involvement</h2>
<p>In October of 1992, President Bush issued a statement detailing the US’ humanitarian assistance to Bosnia. The US was collaborating with the UN on the implementation of a trade embargo, and UN forces had been deployed in order to deliver relief supplies to the Bosnian people. President Bush acknowledged that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Despite agreements reached at the London conference, Bosnian cities remain under siege, the movement of humanitarian relief convoys is still hazardous, and innocent civilians continue to be slaughtered…There is no easy solution to the Bosnian conflict, let alone the larger Balkan crisis. So we will persist in our strategy of containing and reducing the violence, making the aggressors pay, and relieving the suffering of victims, all the while lending our full support to the quest for a settlement. History shows that what this troubled region needs is not more violence but peaceful change, and I am confident that the steps I am announcing today will help the innocent victims, strengthen the hand of the negotiators and reinforce the pressures for peace” <a href="#bush">(Bush, 1992, pp. 1738-1739)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On May 10, 1994, the arms embargo was lifted on Bosnia-Herzegovina, allowing Bosnian troops to arm themselves in defense against the Serb army more effectively. Senator Simpson underscored this point, noting that “We are not sending Americans to fight in Bosnia if we pass this measure. We are merely permitting Bosnians to defend themselves”<a href="#congressional">(“Lifting the Arms Embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina,” 1994)</a>. Petitions were made for further intervention in the years leading up to the attack on the Srebrenica safe haven in 1995, but involvement stayed at the peacekeeping level with no intervention in the conflict.</p>

<p>On November 21, 1995, President Clinton announced the agreement made in the Dayton Peace Accord, stating that, “After nearly 4 years of 250,000 people killed, 2 million refugees, atrocities that have appalled people all over the world, the people of Bosnia finally have a chance to turn from the horror of war to the promise of peace” <a href="#clinton1995">(Clinton, 1995, p. 1776)</a>. A week later, he addressed the nation again, emphasizing that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“America’s role will not be about fighting a war. It will be about helping the people of Bosnia to secure their own peace agreement. Our mission will be limited, focused, and under the command of an American general. In fulfilling this mission, we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilians, especially children, and at the same time, to bring stability to Central Europe, a region of the world that is vital to our national interests. It is the right thing to do…Horrors we prayed had been banished from Europe forever have been seared into our minds again: skeletal prisoners caged behind barbed-wire fences; women and girls raped as a tool of war; defenseless men and boys shot down into mass graves, evoking visions of World War II concentration camps; and endless lines of refugees marching toward a future of despair…The only force capable of getting this job done is NATO, the powerful military alliance of democracies that has guaranteed our security for half a century now. And as NATO’s leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement, the United States must be an essential part of the mission. If we’re not there, NATO will not be there; the peace will collapse; the war will reignite; the slaughter of innocents will begin again” <a href="#clinton1995">(Clinton, 1995, pp. 1784-1785)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bosnia-Herzegovina is still being monitored and supported with humanitarian aid today, though these responsibilities were mostly transferred to the European Union with the EU’s recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a potential candidate for accession in 2003 <a href="#eu">(“EU relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina,” never-again)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="at-arms-length">At Arm’s Length</h3>
<p>The State utilized a similar approach to foreign policy in both Rwanda and in Bosnia, particularly in its reluctance to assist on the ground until pressure built enough that it was imperative. For instance, the United States exhibited a propensity toward the establishment of arms embargoes as a primary means of response to conflict in both Bosnia and Rwanda. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s ambassador to Pakistan, Sadzida Siladjzic, criticized this approach, saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Unfortunately all the powers which were supposed to create peace in the world have changed into humanitarian aid organizations which are not doing anything. We did not request to be fed and then killed. We did not ask for it. From the very beginning, we had been always telling them that we did not want food; we wanted arms. But they still feed us” <a href="#siladjzic">(Siladjzic, 1994, p. 11)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US was also averse to identifying either of these crises as genocides until it became a matter of credibility with human rights organizations and the public. For example, the topic of language in reference to these crises was brought up for discussion on May 21st in a private memorandum, and it was determined that, in order to maintain credibility with human rights groups and the public, the State Department should be allowed to publicly conclude that “acts of genocide have occurred” in Rwanda. This was the same formulation being used in regard to Bosnia, though in Bosnia it could be stated that genocide was “taking place” <a href="#moose">(Moose, Shattuck, Bennet, &amp; Harper, 2013)</a>.</p>

<p>Such debate around semantics reinforces the US government’s unwillingness to commit to language that would necessitate that they become involved in these conflicts any sooner than required. Speaking to the perceived inaction of the government in Rwanda, Representative Hastings asserted during a Congressional hearing on June 8, 1994 that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“More people have died in 5 weeks in Rwanda than died in Bosnia, and I think that we have been ineffective in Bosnia as well. I suspect that if something like this were taking place in England or France that the whole world would stop and attend to it that day…Obviously, the killers feel that they can get away with it because nobody is doing anything. And by the time we get ready to do something there is nothing left to be done because every damn body is dead. I mean, you know, it is mind boggling” <a href="#conflict">(“Conflict resolution in Africa: Recent developments : hearing and markup before the Subcommittee on Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, One Hundred Third Congress, second session, on H.R. 4541 …  8 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1995, p. 16)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="media-influence">Media Influence</h3>
<p>Another similarity that reveals itself as a force to be reckoned with in future conflicts is the role of the media in the dissemination of information. The media was aggressively used as a tool of war by the Serbs against the Croatians and Bosniaks. Christopher Bennett detailed this, stating that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Media has arguably been the most destructive weapon in the wars of Yugoslav dissolution. Indeed, it is said in the former Yugoslavia that all victims died twice: first on television and then in reality…The Serb national psyche which has so revolted the world since 1991 is not the product of centuries of historical evolution. It has been deliberately manufactured and intensively cultivated by the Serbian media since 1987…More important than what was or was not actually happening in Yugoslavia in the run up to and during the war were perceptions of what was taking place. These depended not on real events but on an atmosphere created by the rival media. As the various republican leaders adopted increasingly antagonistic positions, so did the media they controlled. It was a vicious cycle” <a href="#bennett">(Bennett, 1998)</a>.</p>

<p>Media was also used by the Hutus to spread hateful rhetoric against the Tutsis. Roméo Dallaire noted in this regard that “the genocidaires used the media like a weapon. The haunting image of killers with a machete in one hand and radio in the other never leaves you” <a href="#thompson">(Thompson, Annan, &amp; Centre, 2008, p. 12)</a>.</p>

<p>The international media’s portrayal of the wars in Bosnia and Rwanda played a significant role in the public’s involvement, or the lack thereof. Samantha Power argued that modern media may, in fact, make intervention less likely, noting that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On the one hand, as we saw in Bosnia and Rwanda, the publicity given to mass atrocity can attract public interest and pull foreign governments toward intervention. On the other hand, the seeming intractability of the hatreds, the sight of the carnage, the visible danger to anyone who sets foot in the region, and the apparent remoteness of events from American homes can repel American voters and leaders and keep American troops out. In effect, this very tension may explain the United States’ tendency to deliver a hearty humanitarian response but nonexistent military response to genocide” <a href="#power">(Power, 1998)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>The actions of the US government in response to the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda are subject to great criticism in retrospect. While the State refused to acknowledge the presence of genocide in Europe and in Africa, the media revealed to the world the extent of the brutality that was being committed while simultaneously underscoring the power it can give to those who wish to motivate people for evil purposes. There is, no doubt, a great deal of pressure attached to being the remaining superpower in a world that is filled with tragedy and strife. Any desire to immediately assist those in need will likely be overshadowed by the pain or regret of mistakes of the past.</p>

<p>The mistakes of foreign aid efforts in the 1990s must not be forgotten. The US government would be wise to consider, at the very least, the value of transparency based on their experiences in Bosnia and in Rwanda.</p>

<p>In a world where social media is ever-prevalent, denial of atrocities in Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt or Turkey will not hold for long. The greatest danger of ambiguity is damage to the credibility of institutions such as the UN and NATO that were founded with the desire to protect and empower the world’s citizens. When those institutions use politics and word games to defer responsibility, they empower the oppressors and they lose the trust of their constituents. The oppressed, when pushed to the point of desperation, will eventually decide to take justice into their own hands, and that risks even greater levels of conflict worldwide.</p>

<p>We can’t afford to keep tragedy at arm’s length in a world that is now so tightly–and digitally–interwoven. Senator James Jeffords spoke to this point during a Congressional hearing in July of 1994, stating “Words not backed up by deeds serve merely to embolden the aggressor. We all agree that gunboat diplomacy is not the way for the United States to conduct itself in the world, but I am concerned that by failing to act decisively in certain crises, we are sinking into a pattern of lifeboat diplomacy” <a href="#crisis">(“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 4)</a>.</p>
