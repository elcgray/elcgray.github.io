<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This month, Saudi Arabia announced the completion of the first phase of a multi-billion dollar plan to help protect itself from growing instability and unrest in neighboring countries. A 900-kilometer fence has been installed along the border of Iraq equipped with other security technology such as night-vision cameras, radars, and watchtowers <a href="#mcclatchy">(“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014)</a>. This program will eventually result in the installation of fences along all Saudi Arabian borders and upgraded command and training centers for its Border Guard Forces <a href="#bbc-me">(“Saudi arabia constructs security barrier on iraq border,” 2008)</a>.</p>

<p>It is no coincidence that the first fence constructed was along Saudi Arabia’s border with Iraq, and its completion comes at a time when violent activity in the region to Saudi Arabia’s north is on the rise. But Saudi Arabia has its own internal struggles, as well. The country has played host to terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda, and that relationship didn’t end with the death of Osama bin Laden <a href="#terrorism">(“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006)</a>. Radical opposition groups still exist within the country and are actively combated by the government. To this point, it has been suggested that the fence will also help keep Saudis from crossing the border into Iraq to join jihadist movements and then return home to spread those militant ideals. This leads one to ask what the primary purpose of Saudi Arabia’s fences is. Who do they hope to keep out, who do they want to keep in, and what do these actions mean for the country’s citizens, allies, and its enemies?</p>

<h2 id="al-qaeda">al Qaeda</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia became a recruitment ground for al Qaeda operations during the Afghanistan war in the 1980s. The Saudi Arabian government endorsed the jihadist organization’s activity in the beginning. By the 1990s, popular support for the group had waned; the government became less vocal in their endorsements while turning a blind eye to jihadist activity waged outside of its borders<a href="#terrorism">(“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006)</a>. During the Gulf War, any direct connections between al Qaeda and the Saudi government that existed were dissolved as the royal family established closer ties with the United States. Even still, al Qaeda followers in Saudi Arabia were instructed by bin Laden not to attack oil facilities—allegedly, they planned to use them as a source of finances in the future. Today, the focus has changed—energy and government infrastructures within Saudi Arabia have become primary targets of al Qaeda <a href="#terrorism">(“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006)</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden waged war against the Saudi government due to its perversion of Islam and for allowing United States troops onto soil that was home to the Islam’s holy cities <a href="#riedel">(Riedel &amp; Saab, 2008, p. 33)</a>. The Saudi government likely didn’t take the threats from al Qaeda seriously enough until the “explosions in Riyadh of May 2003 basically stripped them of that sense of invulnerability” <a href="#terrorism">(“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006)</a> The government has since taken the offensive and aggressively combats militant groups within the country.</p>

<h2 id="iraq">Iraq</h2>
<p>Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iraq exist for a variety of reasons. Divisions between them can be partly attributed to their differing Sunni and Shia majorities. Iraq’s suspected alliance with Iran, another distrusted neighbor, also further exacerbates tensions. Saudi Arabia’s primary concern with Iraq at this time seems to be related to its fear of potential blowback from that country’s severe instability and its ties with Shi’ite militant groups. More recently, the Saudi government accused former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of marginalizing the country’s Sunni Arab minority and consequently creating ideal conditions for ISIL, a Sunni jihadist group, to grow rapidly <a href="#mcclatchy">(“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014)</a>. In July 2014, al-Maliki withdrew Iraqi troops from the Saudi Arabian border. Some suggest that this was done to increase pressure on Saudi Arabia and to bring the threat of ISIL to its borders <a href="#solomon">(Solomon, 2014)</a>. Regardless of the intentions behind the withdrawal, unguarded borderland makes it easier for militant groups from any party to move freely and stir up greater violence within the region.</p>

<h2 id="isil">ISIL</h2>
<p>Analysts suggest that private donations from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have contributed to the building of ISIL forces <a href="#solomon">(Solomon, 2014)</a> although the government denies this allegation. Another report suggests that the Saudi Arabian government recently banned its citizens from joining jihad groups in Syria <a href="#solomon">(Solomon, 2014)</a>. It has, however, publicly supported other Sunni militant groups fighting in Syria in the past, and hundreds of Saudi nationals have reportedly joined ISIL regardless of the government’s stance on the group <a href="#arabian">(“Saudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier,” 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>ISIL was originally linked to al Qaeda, but in February 2014, al Qaeda announced that its tie with the group was broken, likely in an attempt to reassert its own authority in Syria’s civil war <a href="#holmes">(Holmes, 2014)</a>. ISIL presents a separate threat to Saudi Arabia’s elite because its proclamation of a caliphate could diminish the validity of country’s rulers among its Sunni population <a href="#solomon">(Solomon, 2014)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="building-fences">Building Fences</h2>
<p>In July 2014, the Saudi Arabian government expressed alarm at ISIL’s expansion in the region. However, militias from Baghdad and Iran were still regarded as bigger threats to the nation’s security <a href="#arabian">(“Saudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier,” 2014)</a>. In light of such concerns, King Abdullah vowed to protect Saudi Arabia both from Sunni ISIL fighters and from Shi’ite Iraqi militias that have mobilised to fight the insurgents <a href="#arabian">(“Saudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier,” 2014)</a>. In July 2014, 30,000 soldiers were deployed to border of Iraq to fill the void left by the withdrawal of Iraqi soldiers from the area <a href="#mcclatchy">(“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>The Saudi government is investing a great deal of money in technology to combat terrorism inside and out of the nation—from fences with night vision cameras to equipment that detects poisonous gases <a href="#terrorism">(“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006)</a>. Originally, the border security program introduced in 2006 was focused on creating a defensive line along Saudi Arabia’s border with Iraq, but by 2009 the program had been expanded to include all borders <a href="#mcclatchy">(“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>Since 2003, military spending has increased by 13% annually <a href="#economist">(“Saudi arabia politics: Arms buying spree,” 2009)</a>. In 2008, the Saudi government allocated over $38 billion to its defense and security budget, which amounts to approximately 35% of the country’s total budget. This is more than was allocated to Saudi Arabia’s health and education spending budgets combined <a href="#economist">(“Saudi arabia politics: Arms buying spree,” 2009)</a>. The Saudi government’s spending priorities help identify another type of fence that was constructed prior to the one on the Iraqi border—that which separates governmental elites from the rest of the population.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s leaders are very concerned with the security of the nation, and rightfully so. Surprisingly, with the exception of some small assaults, Saudi Arabia has never been invaded by a foreign enemy <a href="#david">(David, 2008, p. 61)</a>. The United States has offered the Saudi government significant protection from such threats in previous years, but the fortification of the country’s borders suggests that the government anticipates an increasing need for protection against outside forces. However, an equally significant threat to the Saudi government’s security may come from within. Spending on technology improvements to secure borders, energy, and government infrastructures only addresses part of the problem. Though education and healthcare are provided to all Saudi citizens, the country struggles to provide employment to its growing population—the International Monetary Fund indicates that the unemployment rate among Saudi nationals reached 12% in 2013 and most private sector jobs were held by non-Saudis who are cheaper to employ <a href="#hoetjes">(Hoetjes, 2013)</a>.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, unrest grows under such circumstances and can easily be capitalized upon by extremist groups such as al Qaeda and ISIL. It could even result in an overthrow of the existing regime. Saudi malaise could be further exacerbated by the announcement that Saudi Arabia will ally with the US in opposition to ISIL and host training camps for Syrian fighters <a href="#spencer">(Spencer &amp; Foster, 2014)</a>. Bin Laden was able to use just such a situation to provoke the ire of locals before. Wahhabism, the religion of the dominant majority of the population in Saudi Arabia, is known for its oppositional stance toward the West. Bin Laden was able to exploit the Saudi leadership’s alliance with the United States as an example of the religious double standards that the government held; the introduction of a half-million troops to the Arabian peninsula after the Gulf War simply underscored bin Laden’s message and provoked further rage in Saudi Arabia and in the region <a href="#david">(David, 2008, pp. 51-54)</a>.</p>

<p>The Saudi government’s focus on defending its borders to improve security may be an oversight; its greatest potential threat likely comes from within, and events occurring in the surrounding area could significantly increase tension. A greater focus on improving the legitimate opportunities available to its people could more effectively help the government combat homegrown terrorism. Should a serious challenge to the Saudi government arise, it would be hard for the United States to come to its rescue without potentially provoking the ire of the entire region.</p>
