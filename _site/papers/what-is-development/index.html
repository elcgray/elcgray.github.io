  <h1 class="page-title">What is Development?</h1>
  <p>The development project came about after the Second World War, its focus directed toward &quot;underdeveloped&quot; or &quot;backwards&quot; areas of the world, many of which were once colonies of the countries now intent upon stabilizing and integrating them into the postwar world--a plan pursued in part to ensure the welfare of the new world order. The general goal was to establish stable monetary relations with the introduction of capitalism, and the initial approach was that of replication of the processes that worked for those who identified themselves as &quot;developed&quot;--predominantly those in Western Europe and the United States. With the establishment of a monetary regime through the Bretton Woods agreements in 1944, the gears of a new world order, took motion (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pp. 216-217).</p>

<p>Those who were part of the First and Second World--demarcations which were created to identify a countries&#39; embodiment of either democratic or communist-socialist ideals--focused on development of military and economic assistance programs for the purpose of raising and protecting living standards worldwide (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pp. 218-221). As Polanyi&#39;s pendulum acknowledges, the space in between the market and the statist models of development is vast (Stewart, 2010, pp. 371-373), and the fluctuation between support of these models appears to be equally so. His assessment of the socio-economic and political impacts of policy strongly favoring either side of the spectrum identifies one commonality--the reaction of the people those policies affect eventually results in a swing of support to the opposite model in an attempt to balance out those inequities identified in the current system.</p>

<p>Development as it stands today has evolved quite significantly from earlier models whose focus tended to be concentrated on one core function, often an economic (such as the world-system model) or social strategy (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pg. 242), to solve the developing world&#39;s problems. Polanyi&#39;s pendulum reinforces the notion that such a tight focus when creating a development plan hasn&#39;t yet proven itself to be effective. Assumptions of universality and prioritization of Western methods cause a plan to lose its pertinence to outside groups in part because it is then perceived to come from an ethnocentric perspective (Martinussen, 1999, pg. 4). According to Martinussen, development can be defined as &quot;the societal reproduction and transformation processes of the developing countries, in conjunction with the international factors that influence these processes&quot; (Martinussen, 1999, pg. 4) This definition emphasizes the fact that the solutions we&#39;ve established are best for us based on <em>our</em> geographic location and <em>our</em> cultural backgrounds are not guaranteed to be applicable to societies outside of our bubble, be it cultural, geographic or otherwise. Utilitarian views such as those of John Stuart Mill and other classical political economists fail us in their overly simplistic views of the world&#39;s needs, relying heavily on generalizations and abstractions (Martinussen, 1999, pp. 19-24). Sen further criticized this approach, stating, &quot;The victory of utilitarianism not only suppressed the claims of rival theories, it also corrupted and deformed the intellectual basis of the claims underlying these theories by making their advocates opt for a subsidiary route to influence via their effects on utilities&quot; (Sen, 2000, p. 20).</p>

<p>Stiglitz, in reference to the growing power of the International Monetary Fund warns of our return to a colonial mentality as we, &quot;the establishment&quot;, preach to those in less developed nations on the importance of discipline and the criticality of capital markets in their success, telling them, &quot;do what we tell you to do, and you will prosper&quot; (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, p. 297). This projection of industrial and urbanized concerns and standards on predominantly agricultural and rural entities is errant and can be perceived as undemocratic at best. The concern economists have with income-poverty and employment thinking do, as Roberts stated, &quot;have force but miss much and mislead&quot; (Schischka, Dalziel, &amp; Saunders, 2008, pg. 232).</p>

<p>Since the debt crisis of the 1980s, our perspectives on development have broadened quite significantly. McMichael went so far as to say that the development paradigm had, in fact, collapsed in the wake of the debt crisis, and what rose in its stead was the new organizational principle of globalization (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pp. 216-217). Regardless of the term used to define the project, development and globalism share in common that their purpose is to encourage (through varying means) and assist those countries not yet considered to be part of the capitalist world economy to join the ranks of the First and Second Worlds. Ultimately, the development project led to the globalist movement we are part of today because it focused on moving agrarian countries away from traditional means of living and into the industrial, Westernized realm--all in the name of modernization (Martinussen, 1999, pg. 35).</p>

<p>When the debt crisis of the 1980s came, Polanyi&#39;s pendulum could be seen in motion as the world moved to opposite side of the spectrum, abandoning the inefficient, statist structures adopted in the 1950s and paving the way for the Reagan and Thatcher era of pro-market policy (Stewart, 2010, pp. 377-378). Today, it seems as if the pendulum is beginning to swing back in the direction of the state. The language being used to define development--discussions about the characteristics of human development and Sen&#39;s Capabilities Approach, for instance--make it apparent that individual human rights and investments in social structure and supports are moving back toward the top of the docket. In fact, the United Nations has recently introduced a survey called MY World through which they plan to poll the world&#39;s citizens on what the focus of the new development program beginning in 2015 should be. Participants are required to choose six out of sixteen presented issues that they think are most critical to the world&#39;s future. The choices provided are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better job opportunities</li>
<li>Support for people who can´t work</li>
<li>A good education</li>
<li>Better healthcare</li>
<li>Affordable and nutritious food</li>
<li>Phone and internet access</li>
<li>Better transport and roads</li>
<li>Access to clean water and sanitation</li>
<li>Reliable energy at home</li>
<li>Action taken on climate change</li>
<li>Protecting forests, rivers and oceans</li>
<li>Equality between men and women</li>
<li>Protection against crime and violence</li>
<li>Political freedom</li>
<li>An honest and responsive government</li>
<li>Freedom from discrimination and persecution (United Nations, 2013)</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#39;s most appreciated in the approach taken with this survey is that there seems to be a conscious effort being made to collect input from all over the world. Additionally, when constructing the words used for each of the presented issued, experts in communications and a polling company in Africa were consulted in an attempt to ensure that the language was as bias-free as possible (United Nations, 2013). Friedman would likely say that technological advancements are significant contributors to the kind of approach to development the UN is taking with its survey, as such advancements continue to shrink and flatten the world and empower individuals (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pg. 248). Perhaps this is also the way in which we can and will honor Stiglitz&#39; calls for &quot;a global alliance for reducing poverty and for creating a better environment, an alliance for creating a global society with more social justice&quot; (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pg. 304).</p>

<p>Our advancements toward a more interconnected, global community cannot be denied, though there are many different theories on how best to manage and interpret the consequences of globalization. Supporters may say that homogenization of society and progress toward common goals (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pg. 217) through technology are ideal and benefit everyone while opponents assert that the gaps between rich and poor are wider and harder to bridge and that management of this new system by the likes of the International Monetary Fund or the World Trade Organization are draconian (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pg. 218) at best. Castells comments in this regard that &quot;the global economy does not embrace all economic processes in the planet, it does not include all territories, and it does not include all people in its workings, although it does affect directly or indirectly the livelihood of all humankind,&quot; (Castells, 2000, pg. 132) and posits that inequality and social exclusion will rise (Castells, 2000, pg. 134). Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it&#39;s difficult not to acknowledge that the world&#39;s societies are more closely connected than ever before, and with this comes the new burden of awareness and involvement in the success or failure of our counterparts.</p>

<p>Skair identifies two factors as significant struggles in the process of globalization--geographic differences between countries and the bond between sociology and the nation-state--and questions whether the political-cultural entity of the nation-state will continue to thrive in this new global environment (Roberts &amp; Hite, 2007, pg. 234). It would make sense that a traditional form of organization such as the nation-state would, in time, be replaced by a more modern, inclusive structure, focused on the ever-growing, changing and interdependent global economic market. It&#39;s with this consideration in mind that Castells&#39; assessment that forms of economic organization do not develop in social vacuums and are based in cultures and institutions (Castells, 2000, pg. 188) is incredibly important to consider. As we are developing into a complex global network of organizations and institutions (Castells, 2000, pg. 214), we need to ensure that we&#39;re preparing and utilizing all of our resources in the best and most efficient manner possible, but we cannot forget that humans comprise these institutions and organizations. Technological advancements can be used to accentuate or diminish this truth. Artist Krista Wortendyke stated that &quot;We witness imagery of disaster, devastation, violence, and death every day whether it be by absorbing it through news outlets, watching it unfurl in front of us in movies, or playing out scenarios in video games. Our easy access to information has made us into perpetual witnesses of tragedy&quot; (Constantinou &amp; Zini, 2013). This motivates some and discourages others. It is critical that we focus on development as a means of enabling the growth of each individual component--each human--or risk losing sight of our own humanity. If approaching this argument from a strictly economic perspective, Castells also says that &quot;when business systems interact on a global scale, organizational forms diffuse, borrow from each other, and create a mixture that responds to largely common patterns of production and competition, while adapting to the specific social environments in which they operate&quot; (Castells, 2000, pg. 188). This, too, suggests that the fundamental focus of development should be on providing opportunities for individuals to grow first and foremost, as they&#39;re the most basic component of an economy and are a determining factor in its success or failure.</p>

<p>Sen&#39;s Capability Approach is a prominent development strategy with a focus on the growth of individuals. Its emphasis on education/skills, health, housing, social/community/family/friends, status/confidence, income/finance, and other as dimensions of poverty or underdevelopment (Schischka, Dalziel, &amp; Saunders, 2008, pg. 234) are the basis of my own proposed definition of and strategy for development. In the womb, a child requires security (which could also be defined as safety), health (which considers both freedom from disease and nourishment) and stability (which considers social and economic relationships as part of its definition). Once a child is born, the three aforementioned factors are still necessary, but education is introduced as a new component. Castells reinforces this factor with his belief, stating that &quot;education is of central value, both for social betterment and for personal enhancement&quot; (Castells, 2000, pg. 195). Once a child has grown to be a secure, healthy, stable and educated adult, freedom is the final component in the enabling of human growth. Sen&#39;s Capability Approach defines of freedom as &quot;both (1) the primary end and (2) the principal means of development&quot; (Schischka, Dalziel, &amp; Saunders, 2008, pg. 234). This is further expounded upon with political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees and protective security (Schischka, Dalziel, &amp; Saunders, 2008, pg. 231) being the most instrumental freedoms that can be provided in human development. It&#39;s worth noting that each of these terms need to be refined based on the specific environment they&#39;re employed within. For example, in a city like Chicago, children may need security from gun violence, but it&#39;s unlikely that they&#39;ll need protection from wild predatory animals, as may be the case in other areas of the world.</p>

<p>If development&#39;s focus is on the growth of individuals through the provision of basic needs such as security, health, stability, education and freedom based on the specific cultural and geographic needs, the sights are essentially set on eliminating what Myrdal called &quot;societal stagnation&quot; (Martinussen, 1999, pg. 80) and can be applied not just to countries that are deemed undeveloped but also to those pockets of society within developed countries such as the United States that are underdeveloped (Martinussen, 1999, pg. 81). Addressing those criteria found to be causes of poverty and inequality benefit everyone, helping us move those in need into a &#39;virtuous circle&#39; of self-sustained growth versus remaining in a &#39;vicious circle&#39; of poverty (Martinussen, 1999, pg. 79). Once humans are safe, healthy, stable, educated and free, they&#39;re much more capable to participate in and contribute to the global human network we live within today.</p>
