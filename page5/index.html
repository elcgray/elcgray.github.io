<h2>2015</h2>

<p>Tunisia is considered to be the Arab uprisings&#39; greatest success story. This has has been attributed to some common factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>The interim government focused first on creating a constitution that established human rights as law and <em>then</em> held elections for a permanent government <a href="#levine">(LeVine, 2015)</a>.</li>
<li>Tunisia didn&#39;t get the international attention or pressure that other countries like Libya and Egypt did, so their transition was more natural <a href="#ryan">(Ryan, 2014, p. 20)</a>.</li>
<li>Election results were not interfered with as they were in Egypt; Tunisia&#39;s Islamic government was not removed by the military <a href="#mclarney">(McLarney, 2015)</a>.</li>
<li>Tunisia is relatively small geographically, and the majority of the population have the same ethnic and religious backgrounds <a href="#keating">(Keating, 2015)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The country held its second round of democratic elections at the end of 2014. Secularist party Nidaa Tounes assumed majority control over parliament and formed a coalition government with Islamist party, Ennahda, in early 2015 <a href="#mclarney">(McLarney, 2015)</a>.</p>

<h3><em>Ongoing issues</em></h3>

<p>Of the <a href="/2015/03/26/smau-background-tunisia#triggers">triggers</a> attributed to the start of the revolution, repression and censorship have <a href="/2015/04/12/smau-sm-today-tunisia#freedom-house">decreased most significantly</a>. Economic disparity and concerns about corruption are still ongoing issues within the country.</p>

<h4>Corruption</h4>

<p>Concerns have been expressed about the election of Essebsi, a remnant of the Bourguiba and Ben Ali eras, and a party which includes several prominent old regime players from the RCD. Teyeb and Levine accused the transitional government of failing to prosecute politicians who worked with or within the Ben Ali regime. As a result, RCD supporters have continued to influence the political, economic, and social realms, contributing to an increase in corruption post-revolution <a href="#teyeb">(Teyeb, 2014; LeVine, 2015)</a>.</p>

<p>Teyeb warns that the &quot;RCD machine&quot; is &quot;implanted in all the components of the State, from public services to education, health sector, business and the media&quot; and that &quot;any setback for Tunisia’s recent democratic achievements will mean a threat to freedom of the press, to transparency and good governance, to political plurality&quot; <a href="#teyeb">(Teyeb, 2014)</a>.</p>

<h4>Economic disparity</h4>

<p>The Tunisian interim government&#39;s decision to focus first on creating a constitution and a stable political institution has left the economy in a state of neglect: &quot;Today, excitement over the constitution is tempered by economic hardship. Newly acquired political freedoms are widely perceived as having come at the price of economic stability and security&quot; <a href="#ryan">(Ryan, 2014, p. 21)</a>. And economic stability plays a hand in the security of the country, as Levine asserts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same dynamics of unemployment, marginalisation and lack of a future that helped radicalise the killers of Paris, is also quite present in Tunisia, which accounts for the rapid rise of extremism under the democratic transition, including the disproportionately large participation of young Tunisians in jihadist activities in Iraq and Syria <a href="#levine">(LeVine, 2015)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Extremist groups like ISIL are also threats to internal security. This was underscored in March 2015 when <a href="http://m.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31941672">terrorists attacked tourists</a> at the Bardo museum in Tunis.</p>

<p>Tunisia&#39;s ambassador to the US, Mohamed Chelaifa acknowledged the need to address socio-economic inequalities, saying &quot;it was Tunisia&#39;s high unemployment and poor economic conditions that sparked the uprising&quot; <a href="#hanley">(Hanley, 2014)</a>.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>Parallels can be drawn between Tunisia&#39;s struggles and those we have in the United States:  </p>

<ul>
<li>We have extremists, and sometimes they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/us/shooting-reported-at-temple-in-wisconsin.html">kill people</a>.</li>
<li>CEOs make up to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2014/04/15/report-ceos-earn-331-times-as-much-as-average-workers-774-times-as-much-as-minimum-wage-earners/">774 times</a> as much as minimum wage workers who are protesting for <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/15/fight-for-15-minimum-wage-protests-new-york-los-angeles-atlanta-boston">$15 an hour</a>.</li>
<li>The uneducated, the disaffected, and the desperate are targets for <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment">recruitment by gangs</a>.</li>
<li>We&#39;ve experienced <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/7/gridlock-in-congress-rekindled-quickly-despite-dem/?page=all">gridlock in Congress</a> and we&#39;ve seen and heard demands for the <a href="http://www.teaparty.org/impeach-obama-petition/">removal of leaders</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Concerns about corruption and economic disparity are valid but should not undermine the significance of the accomplishments Tunisia has made. If Tunisia&#39;s new leaders find ways to earnestly engage the youth who first called for revolution, it is far more likely that these complex issues can be effectively addressed. Engaging the disenfranchised—giving them a sense of purpose and hope—could also help delegitimize extremist factions looking for recruits.</p>

<h2>Next up</h2>

<p>We&#39;ll look at the status and stability of governmental institutions in Egypt today. See <a href="/projects/arab-uprisings/summary">here</a> for more details.</p>
