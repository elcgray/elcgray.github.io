<h1 id="what-triggered-the-movements-in-tunisia">What triggered the movements in Tunisia?</h1>
<p>Mohamed Bouazizi’s self immolation in late 2010 may have been the spark that ignited the Tunisian uprisings that would overthrow Ben Ali in January of 2011, but the country’s history of corruption, repression, and censorship combined with increased economic disparity made it into a tinderbox.</p>

<h2 id="corruption"><em>Corruption</em></h2>
<p>Tunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, and Habib Bourguiba became the country’s first leader. As such, he and his party worked to liberalize the nation. Women’s and minority rights, public access to education, and constitutional reform were attained very early on. Despite what appeared to be a promising start, Bourguiba had a penchant for control; he slowly and strategically took command over the media, labor organizations, and political parties and movements by establishing himself as the “maker and breaker of political careers” <a href="#alexander">(Alexander, 2013, pp. 953-956)</a> through the use of incentives to those who were loyal and the repression of dissidents.</p>

<p>Corruption reigned under both Bourguiba and Ben Ali’s rule, but up until the 1980s, Tunisians generally tolerated this repressive institution in exchange for relative security from economic hardship. When economic growth and stability disappeared in the 1980s, the regime could no longer buy Tunisian support for their corrupt and increasingly greedy practices. Ben Ali ousted Bourguiba in 1986, inheriting a broken political system and an increasingly severe economic crisis. Like his predecessor, Ben Ali was able to use internal divisions to his advantage, maintaining control of the regime through a <em>dispositif de quadrillage</em>, or “control grid” <a href="#marzouki">(Marzouki, 2013, p. 533)</a> based on repression and fear.</p>

<h2 id="repression"><em>Repression</em></h2>
<p>Bourguiba discretely secured his position of power through the division of opposing political parties and the manipulation of individuals striving to gain or maintain his favor. Ben Ali, however, relied heavily on violence to repress Tunisian dissent as raids, house inspections, and torture become increasingly commonplace. In 2007, Human Rights Watch reported that “the government uses the threat of terrorism and religious extremism as a pretext to crack down on peaceful dissent” <a href="#kallander">(Kallander, 2013, p. 830)</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast to other countries in the region, both Bourguiba and Ben Ali marginalized military forces in the management of Tunisia and intentionally underfunded and understaffed it. Concurrently, Tunisia became one of the most heavily policed states in the world. By 2002, the police and intelligence forces were estimated to have over 100,000 members in a country of approximately 10 million people. Police forces were the channel through which Tunisians connected to state services, but they also functioned as the main surveillance structure for the country.</p>

<p><a name="enemy"></a></p>

<h2 id="censorship"><em>Censorship</em></h2>
<p>Other aggressive tactics were employed alongside physical violence in an attempt to silence the voice of dissent. Citizens knew that the state-run media was a mechanism for propaganda; newspapers were owned by members of Ben Ali’s family, and the government wrote most content for radio and television. As a result, dissatisfied Tunisians relied heavily on the Internet for information. This too was censored by the regime. Users trying to access social media sites, blogs, or other sites the government associated with dissidence would instead see a “404 Not Found” error. This earned the nation a place on Reporters Without Borders’ list of “Internet Enemies” <a href="#kallander">(Kallander, 2013, p. 781)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="economic-disparity"><em>Economic disparity</em></h2>
<p>Over time, Tunisia became increasingly indebted to foreign lenders who offered financial assistance in exchange for adherence to the neoliberal policies set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These economic reforms began under Bourguiba and continued under Ben Ali. Privatization and globalization of the national economy were prescribed by the IMF, and Ben Ali embraced these policies as he, his family, and his loyal subjects positioned themselves to reap the benefits of the new structure.</p>

<p>The foreign lenders’ structural adjustment plan emphasized the need for reduced state spending, so public investments in health care, education, and pensions were cut. IMF and World Bank-backed transfers of land out of the hands of small farmers and into the hands of large landholders took place between 1986 and 1996, and Tunisia shifted from being a net agricultural exporter to a net importer <a href="#ciezadlo">(Ciezadlo, 2011, p. 3455)</a>. Despite the theoretical justifications of a structural adjustment program based on “trickle-down” economics, no net job creation resulted, and Tunisia’s poor became poorer and less secure <a href="#king">(King, 2013, pp. 1066-1163)</a>. The editors of <em>The Arab Revolts</em> summarized the results of these policies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The uneven development of the last four decades has exacerbated historical tensions and disparities between urban and rural Tunisians. What investment was earmarked for rural projects-millions in loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, among other sources-ultimately profited the agrarian elites who formed the backbone of Tunisia’s post-colonial ruling class” <a href="#mcmurray">(McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 424)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When state subsidies on food staples were removed in 1984 the people rioted against the government. These bread riots were an indication of the increased dissatisfaction with the government that was to come.</p>

<p>The middle class deteriorated, and the country’s un- and underemployment rates spiked. Those hardest hit were citizens holding university degrees; 46% were without jobs commensurate with their educations <a href="#marzouki">(Marzouki, 2013, p. 548)</a>.</p>

<p>Despite all of this, in 2008 the West dubbed the economic reform in Tunisia a success and even a “good example for emerging countries”<a href="#marzouki">(Marzouki, 2013, p. 520)</a>.</p>

<h1 id="how-was-the-revolution-accomplished">How was the revolution accomplished?</h1>
<p>The world reacted with surprise when it became clear that Tunisia had initiated an uprising that would quickly spread across the MENA region. In retrospect, it is much clearer that Tunisian’s experience organizing movements and sidestepping censorship tools helped enable them to unite as one people, intent upon overthrowing the regime.</p>

<h2 id="al-shab-al-tunisi"><em>Al-sha‘b al-tunisi</em></h2>
<p>During the bread riots of 1983-1984, the regime referred to “the people” primarily in a patronizing fashion <a href="#marzouki">(Marzouki, 2013, p. 633)</a>. Western media were quick to conclude that the riots after Bouazizi’s self immolation were another bread riot, and the people of Tunisia responded to this with the slogan <em>ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam</em>, or “the people want the fall of the regime” <a href="#marzouki">(Marzouki, 2013, p. 626)</a>. In the time leading up to the uprising of 2010, the concept of <em>sha‘b</em>, or “the people” grew to represent the ideals of a more united and pluralistic society. Sha’b, in comparison to the state, communicated a message of inclusivity and of dignity.</p>

<h2 id="organized-movements"><em>Organized movements</em></h2>
<p>Tunisia’s history of collective action despite the repression of Bouagigi and Ben Ali’s regimes plays an integral role in the eventual removal of a well-established regime. In 2008, protests exploded in the western town of Resdayef and then spread to neighboring towns in the region. Even with a media blackout, news of the riots spread beyond Tunisia’s borders and inspired acts of solidarity online and in cities throughout the country <a href="#chomiak">(Chomiak &amp; Entelis, 2013, p. 1292)</a>.</p>

<p>Mine workers were on strike for several months before being overcome by the military <a href="#mcmurray">(McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 453)</a>. In May of 2010, Tunisie en Blanc (Tunisia in White)—a peaceful demonstration against Internet censorship—was organized via Facebook and Twitter and called for people to “dress in white and have coffee on the avenue” <a href="#chomiak">(Chomiak &amp; Entelis, 2013, pp. 1299-1301)</a>. Though individually unsuccessful, movements such as these are credited as being a foundation upon which the 2010 riots could eventually succeed. The people had begun to rediscover their voice.</p>

<h2 id="social-media"><em>Social media</em></h2>
<p><a name="tech"></a>The use of social media in the Tunisian uprisings was aided by the fact that the country has one of the highest rates of Internet and mobile phone penetration in the region. The revolt in Tunisia came to be referred to as the first “Twitter revolution,” as citizens documented the regime’s violence, disseminated that information, and then coordinated protests through the network. Union workers went on strike, and over two million Tunisians changed their Facebook profiles to say, “Ben Ali dégage!” or “Ben Ali, leave!” <a href="#chomiak">(Chomiak &amp; Entelis, 2013, p. 1266)</a> and Al Jazeera covered the revolts and developed a program to allow mobile phones to collect to its satellite. Anonymous’ “Operation Tunisia” took down Ben Ali’s website as well as other government sites. The ability with which citizens united and coordinated their message was undoubtedly facilitated by social media tools, but the experience gained from organized movements of the past was imperative to their efficacy.</p>

<p><a name="jan14"></a></p>

<h1 id="january-2011">January 2011</h1>
<p>The people of Tunisia found their voice, and with it they made their message clear: they demanded the removal of the regime, freedom from oppression and corruption, and dignity. But Ben Ali still failed to understand their message. Showing just how out-of-touch he was with his subjects, he offered to stop censoring sites like YouTube in an attempt to placate protestors on January 13th <a href="#marzouki">(Marzouki, 2013, p. 604)</a>. On January 14th, after the military turned against him, refusing to fire on protestors, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p><a name="divide-and-conquer"></a></p>

<h1 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h1>
<p>Those who wish to oppress others do so by instilling fear—of terrorism, the “other”, or the regime itself—and by promoting division among the “rank and file.” Tunisia’s history provides us with a rich example of the power that finding common ground or a cause to unite behind can wield. We are increasingly interconnected through the use of technology (like social media) and should use it to learn from and support each other. Finally, “one-size-fits-all” development tactics are unlikely to succeed. Privatization and globalization of markets may help an economy legitimately thrive where inclusive institutions exist, but they’re likely to promote corruption and increase the gap between the rich and the poor if extractive institutions exist. Take a look at <a href="http://whynationsfail.com/blog/2012/5/1/who-are-the-extractive-elites.html">this blog post</a> for more on that subject.</p>
