        <title>Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Egypt&#39;s Background</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;What triggered the movements in Egypt?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MENA region was watching as Tunisians ousted their autocratic regime. Egyptians undoubtedly saw similarities in their own situation—a repressive, corrupt regime and growing economic disparity. Ben Ali fled Tunisia on January 14, 2011; soon after, Egypt&amp;#39;s initial call to arms was set for January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corruption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Egyptian intellectual coined the term &lt;em&gt;julukiyya&lt;/em&gt; to describe a monarchy (&lt;em&gt;malakiyya&lt;/em&gt;) disguised by outward displays of republicanism (&lt;em&gt;jumhuriyya&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;#mcmurray&quot;&gt;(McMurray &amp;amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 214)&lt;/a&gt;. The term has been used to describe Mubarak&amp;#39;s Egypt. Presidential elections were a one-party referendum up until 2005, and many suspected that Hosni Mubarak was grooming his son, Gamal, to succeed him. He had already been put in government and party roles related to furthering the neoliberalization of the economy; resultant private-sector developments helped the Mubaraks amass billions of dollars in personal wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mubarak and the National Democratic Party (NDP) entertained appeals for democracy through the careful control of political parties and elections as well as other civic organizations, &amp;quot;providing space for just enough participatory politics to keep people busy without threatening regime dominance&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1611)&lt;/a&gt; and, unlike in Tunisia, the media was relatively free. Mubarak didn&amp;#39;t try to suppress dissent so much as manage it. He relied upon the state police forces to promote fear, distrust, and disunity. Additionally, rather than acting on behalf of workers, the Egyptian Trade Union Federation was used as a state-sanctioned means of control over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military—or &amp;quot;Military Inc.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#marshall&quot;&gt;(Marshall &amp;amp; Stacher, 2013, pp. 2879-2886)&lt;/a&gt;—has historically had its own political and economic priorities. For instance, the army controls industries ranging from the production of olive oil to voting booths. Since military holdings and spending are considered to be state secrets, no one knows exactly how much of Egypt&amp;#39;s economy the military controls. It is known, however, that the army &amp;quot;oversees numerous subsidiaries of state-owned holding companies and owns shares in public-private ventures. In many cases, these smaller operations are embedded in transnational conglomerates that reach into several economic sectors, from construction and maritime shipping to weapons manufacturing&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#marshall&quot;&gt;(Marshall &amp;amp; Stacher, 2013, p. 2887)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic disparity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Tunisia, Egypt also became indebted to foreign lenders and was subject to structural adjustment plans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Funds for public services were cut and privatization plans were initiated under President Sadat and then expanded upon under Mubarak. Land was consolidated into large tracts for industrial agriculture and real estate development and managed by private corporations or wealthy families. In the 1980s, the World Bank led infrastructure-building efforts for tourist development using public funds and then routed profits from it into privately controlled outside entities in the 1990s. One young man&amp;#39;s assessment of working in the tourist development was that &amp;quot;life was a meal you never got to eat&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#mitchell&quot;&gt;(Mitchell, 2013, p. 2064)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices rose and wages remained the same or declined. In 2008, there were shortages of bread at the subsidized cost, and bread in private bakeries cost 5 times as much. This was unaffordable to some 40 percent of the population living on less than $2 per day and resulted in riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt had a large percentage of youth—two thirds of the population were under the age of 30, and unemployment rates were 10 times greater for college graduates than those without a degree &lt;a href=&quot;#castells&quot;&gt;(Castells, 2013, p. 1044)&lt;/a&gt;. Underemployment was another concern. In 2010, estimates suggested that 3 million Egyptians had been hired as temp workers with monthly salaries around 100 Egyptian pounds per month (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=100&amp;amp;From=EGP&amp;amp;To=USD&quot;&gt;about $13&lt;/a&gt;), without health benefits, and under terms that gave employers the right to fire them without reason or warning. The government&amp;#39;s increase of the monthly minimum wage to 400 Egyptian pounds (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=400&amp;amp;From=EGP&amp;amp;To=USD&quot;&gt;about $52&lt;/a&gt;) didn&amp;#39;t apply to any of the 7 million people working in the informal economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impunity of Mubarak&amp;#39;s police force became well known over the course of his three decades in power. El Ghobashyi noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coercive apparatus had become the chief administrative arm of the state, aggregating the functions of several agencies. Police not only dealt with crime and issued passports, drivers’ licenses, and birth and death certificates. They also resolved local conflicts over land and sectarian relations; fixed all national and sub-national elections; vetted graduate school candidates and academic appointments at every level; monitored shop floors and mediated worker-management conflicts; observed soccer games and Friday prayers; and maintained a network of local informants in poor neighborhoods, to ensure that dispossession was not converted into political organization &lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(McMurray &amp;amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 1676)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anti-terrorism laws were used to justify attacks on Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Reports of torture became so commonplace that the regime didn&amp;#39;t bother denying them. Egyptians were pushed to the brink in 2010 when word spread that police had dragged a young man, Khalid Sa&amp;#39;id, out of an Internet cafe and then beaten him to death. It was alleged to be petty drug arrest, but Sa&amp;#39;id had recently shared a video exposing police corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How was the revolution accomplished?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time Tunisia&amp;#39;s regime fell, Egyptians were ready to take on their own government. Appropriately enough, January 25th was a bank holiday designated &amp;quot;Police Day,&amp;quot; so the date was set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media was used heavily in the days leading up to January 25th. The organization that started a “We Are All Khalid Sa‘id” Facebook page and staged protests against police brutality and human rights abuses in 2010 was also a significant player in the demonstrations against the government on January 25, 2011. Videos sharing scenes of police brutality were used to call Egyptians to join them in the street. Protest groups from many different backgrounds—worker&amp;#39;s unions, actors, soccer fans, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgZMz3encLE&quot;&gt;Khalid Sa&amp;#39;id&amp;#39;s mother&lt;/a&gt;—confirmed their participation and urged others to join them in opposition to the regime &lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1712)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 6 Youth Movement was formed in solidarity with textile workers in 2008 and had a following of over 70,000 people on Facebook. One of its founders, Asmaa Mafhouz, posted a video on Facebook on January 18th calling Egyptians to action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to Tahrir on January 25th … If you stay home, you deserve all that’s being done to you, and you will be guilty before your nation and your people. Go down to the street, send SMSs, post it on the Net, make people aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video went viral, leading it to be referred to as “The Vlog that Helped Spark the Revolution” &lt;a href=&quot;#castells&quot;&gt;(Castells, 2013, p. 877)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 27th, the government shut down Internet and cellular phone service in an attempt to keep protestors from communicating with each other. The reaction this elicited was apparently unexpected by the police, but as Sadek noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I were an apathetic young person who could not care less about the political protests, if you took away something vital to my daily life I would go out and protest against that. Many people joined the protests that day only because when Internet and phones were cut off they could not find out what was going on any other way. And once they felt the power of freedom even for a minute, they could not go back &lt;a href=&quot;#sadek&quot;&gt;(Sadek, 2012, p. 1132)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activists across the globe also pooled resources to help connect Egyptians to each other in the same way they had for Tunisians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organized movements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mubarak&amp;#39;s security forces maintained control by promoting fragmentation and distrust between interest groups. Even well-organized movements with large followings like that of the April 6 Youth were effectively suppressed when they went up against the regime by themselves. In 2009, a political scientist with allegiance to Mubarak illustrated how confident the regime was in its control, saying “widespread, politically motivated unrest was unlikely because it was not part of the ‘Egyptian mentality’&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1653)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the government&amp;#39;s success record against protests, the 2000s were a decade of increased incidents of collective action, and it took place in the street. Between 2004 and 2008, over 2,000 strikes consisting of 1.5 million Egyptian workers were held. They demanded increases in pay and fair working conditions. Between 2004 and 2011, middle class activist groups and professional associations organized rallies and protests against the continued use of emergency laws and the repression of journalists. Political demonstrations united student, Islamist, labor, and professional groups. Even the fan networks of Egyptian soccer teams had a history of demonstrations against the police. The obviously rigged results of the national legislative elections at the end of 2010 also enraged citizens and political elites to protest in December 2010 &lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(El Ghobashyi, 2013, pp. 1698-1703)&lt;/a&gt; and contributed to the unification that occurred on January 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By January 2011, organizers had seasoned tactics for combatting Mubarak&amp;#39;s security forces. They started by publicly announcing a false time and location for January 25th&amp;#39;s demonstrations and then disseminating actual plans by phone so that they could gather large crowds on their way through side streets and then overwhelm security forces as they encountered them &lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1749)&lt;/a&gt;. In the days that followed, additional groups such as the Nasserists and the Muslim Brothers joined the protests. On Friday, January 28th, the masses surrounded the institutions they associated with Mubarak&amp;#39;s regime—police stations, government buildings, and NDP headquarters—and demanded their removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobilization and unification of vastly different interest groups—industrial and farm laborers, civil and professional workers, students, religious, political, and social organizations—behind a single message caught the regime off guard and led to the eventual removal of Mubarak. El Ghobashyi asserts, &amp;quot;The genius of the Egyptian revolution was its methodical restoration of the public weal. The uprising restored the meaning of politics, if by that term is understood the making of collective claims on government. It revalued the people, revealing them in all their complexity-neither heroes nor saints, but citizens&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#elghobashyi&quot;&gt;(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1981)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;February 2011&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A regime accustomed to serially addressing disparate protest groups was unable to withstand Egyptians&amp;#39; united front. The people rejected the economic policies that had steadily increased the gap between rich and poor for decades. They rejected pervasive corruption and repression and embraced the hope for reform that Tunisia&amp;#39;s uprising had instilled within them, and they effectively utilized social media to organize and disseminate their message. When the military refused to fire on protestors and removed their support from the regime, Hosni Mubarek had little choice but to resign; he did so on February 11, 2011. After witnessing what happened in Egypt, the people of the MENA region began to rise up in demand of dignity and in opposition to their own repressive and corrupt regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Demanding Dignity&lt;/em&gt;, Dina Sadek recounts a scene she witnessed as she stood in Tahrir Square:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am never going to forget the face of an older man in his sixties who was standing in the square. He was checking on a young man who had a bandage on his head due to being injured by a stone. The old man cried and apologized to the young protester, “I am sorry, I am really sorry you have to go through this now. If only my generation had been brave enough to do this a long time ago, you wouldn’t have to go through this now &lt;a href=&quot;#sadek&quot;&gt;(Sadek, 2012, p. 1090)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Ali and Mubarak aren&amp;#39;t the first leaders to blatantly abuse human rights and betray their constituents. Such atrocities often build gradually and systematically rather than appearing suddenly. Though it isn&amp;#39;t a guaranteed deterrent against autocracy, we all can and should be vigilant against the diminishment of human rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each technological advancement, we become more interconnected. This makes it easier to witness and react to crimes against humanity throughout the world. It also means that it&amp;#39;s easier to become overwhelmed and desensitized, but if we aren&amp;#39;t brave enough to stand up to those who violate our rights as humans now, we&amp;#39;re setting future generations up for an even greater struggle. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html&quot;&gt;letter from Birmingham jail&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Next up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll explore Libya&amp;#39;s background leading up to the revolution of 2011. See &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/arab-uprisings/summary&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Tunisia&#39;s Background</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;What triggered the movements in Tunisia?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Bouazizi&amp;#39;s self immolation in late 2010 may have been the spark that ignited the Tunisian uprisings that would overthrow Ben Ali in January of 2011, but the country&amp;#39;s history of corruption, repression, and censorship combined with increased economic disparity made it into a tinderbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corruption&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, and Habib Bourguiba became the country&amp;#39;s first leader. As such, he and his party worked to liberalize the nation. Women&amp;#39;s and minority rights, public access to education, and constitutional reform were attained very early on. Despite what appeared to be a promising start, Bourguiba had a penchant for control; he slowly and strategically took command over the media, labor organizations, and political parties and movements by establishing himself as the &amp;quot;maker and breaker of political careers&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#alexander&quot;&gt;(Alexander, 2013, pp. 953-956)&lt;/a&gt; through the use of incentives to those who were loyal and the repression of dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption reigned under both Bourguiba and Ben Ali&amp;#39;s rule, but up until the 1980s, Tunisians generally tolerated this repressive institution in exchange for relative security from economic hardship. When economic growth and stability disappeared in the 1980s, the regime could no longer buy Tunisian support for their corrupt and increasingly greedy practices. Ben Ali ousted Bourguiba in 1986, inheriting a broken political system and an increasingly severe economic crisis. Like his predecessor, Ben Ali was able to use internal divisions to his advantage, maintaining control of the regime through a &lt;em&gt;dispositif de quadrillage&lt;/em&gt;, or &amp;quot;control grid&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#marzouki&quot;&gt;(Marzouki, 2013, p. 533)&lt;/a&gt; based on repression and fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bourguiba discretely secured his position of power through the division of opposing political parties and the manipulation of individuals striving to gain or maintain his favor. Ben Ali, however, relied heavily on violence to repress Tunisian dissent as raids, house inspections, and torture become increasingly commonplace. In 2007, Human Rights Watch reported that “the government uses the threat of terrorism and religious extremism as a pretext to crack down on peaceful dissent” &lt;a href=&quot;#kallander&quot;&gt;(Kallander, 2013, p. 830)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to other countries in the region, both Bourguiba and Ben Ali marginalized military forces in the management of Tunisia and intentionally underfunded and understaffed it. Concurrently, Tunisia became one of the most heavily policed states in the world. By 2002, the police and intelligence forces were estimated to have over 100,000 members in a country of approximately 10 million people. Police forces were the channel through which Tunisians connected to state services, but they also functioned as the main surveillance structure for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Censorship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other aggressive tactics were employed alongside physical violence in an attempt to silence the voice of dissent. Citizens knew that the state-run media was a mechanism for propaganda; newspapers were owned by members of Ben Ali&amp;#39;s family, and the government wrote most content for radio and television. As a result, dissatisfied Tunisians relied heavily on the Internet for information. This too was censored by the regime. Users trying to access social media sites, blogs, or other sites the government associated with dissidence would instead see a &amp;quot;404 Not Found&amp;quot; error. This earned the nation a place on Reporters Without Borders&amp;#39; list of &amp;quot;Internet Enemies&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#kallander&quot;&gt;(Kallander, 2013, p. 781)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Economic disparity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, Tunisia became increasingly indebted to foreign lenders who offered financial assistance in exchange for adherence to the neoliberal policies set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These economic reforms began under Bourguiba and continued under Ben Ali. Privatization and globalization of the national economy were prescribed by the IMF, and Ben Ali embraced these policies as he, his family, and his loyal subjects positioned themselves to reap the benefits of the new structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foreign lenders&amp;#39; structural adjustment plan emphasized the need for reduced state spending, so public investments in health care, education, and pensions were cut. IMF and World Bank-backed transfers of land out of the hands of small farmers and into the hands of large landholders took place between 1986 and 1996, and Tunisia shifted from being a net agricultural exporter to a net importer &lt;a href=&quot;#ciezadlo&quot;&gt;(Ciezadlo, 2011, p. 3455)&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the theoretical justifications of a structural adjustment program based on &amp;quot;trickle-down&amp;quot; economics, no net job creation resulted, and Tunisia&amp;#39;s poor became poorer and less secure &lt;a href=&quot;#king&quot;&gt;(King, 2013, pp. 1066-1163)&lt;/a&gt;. The editors of &lt;em&gt;The Arab Revolts&lt;/em&gt; summarized the results of these policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The uneven development of the last four decades has exacerbated historical tensions and disparities between urban and rural Tunisians. What investment was earmarked for rural projects-millions in loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, among other sources-ultimately profited the agrarian elites who formed the backbone of Tunisia’s post-colonial ruling class&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#mcmurray&quot;&gt;(McMurray &amp;amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 424)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When state subsidies on food staples were removed in 1984 the people rioted against the government. These bread riots were an indication of the increased dissatisfaction with the government that was to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The middle class deteriorated, and the country&amp;#39;s un- and underemployment rates spiked. Those hardest hit were citizens holding university degrees; 46% were without jobs commensurate with their educations &lt;a href=&quot;#marzouki&quot;&gt;(Marzouki, 2013, p. 548)&lt;/a&gt;. Bouazizi was one of those degree-holding unemployed youths; selling fruit was his means of providing for himself and his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, in 2008 the West dubbed the economic reform in Tunisia a success and even a &amp;quot;good example for emerging countries&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;#marzouki&quot;&gt;(Marzouki, 2013, p. 520)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How was the revolution accomplished?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world reacted with surprise when it became clear that Tunisia had initiated an uprising that would quickly spread across the MENA region. In retrospect, it is much clearer that Tunisian&amp;#39;s experience organizing movements and sidestepping censorship tools helped enable them to unite as one people, intent upon overthrowing the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al-sha‘b al-tunisi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the bread riots of 1983-1984, the regime referred to &amp;quot;the people&amp;quot; primarily in a patronizing fashion &lt;a href=&quot;#marzouki&quot;&gt;(Marzouki, 2013, p. 633)&lt;/a&gt;. Western media were quick to conclude that the riots after Bouazizi&amp;#39;s self immolation were another bread riot, and the people of Tunisia responded to this with the slogan &lt;em&gt;ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam&lt;/em&gt;, or &amp;quot;the people want the fall of the regime&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#marzouki&quot;&gt;(Marzouki, 2013, p. 626)&lt;/a&gt;. In the time leading up to the uprising of 2010, the concept of &lt;em&gt;sha‘b&lt;/em&gt;, or &amp;quot;the people&amp;quot; grew to represent the ideals of a more united and pluralistic society. Sha&amp;#39;b, in comparison to the state, communicated a message of inclusivity and of dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organized movements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tunisia&amp;#39;s history of collective action despite the repression of Bouagigi and Ben Ali&amp;#39;s regimes plays an integral role in the eventual removal of a well-established regime. In 2008, protests exploded in the western town of Resdayef and then spread to neighboring towns in the region. Even with a media blackout, news of the riots spread beyond Tunisia&amp;#39;s borders and inspired acts of solidarity online and in cities throughout the country &lt;a href=&quot;#chomiak&quot;&gt;(Chomiak &amp;amp; Entelis, 2013, p. 1292)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine workers were on strike for several months before being overcome by the military &lt;a href=&quot;#mcmurray&quot;&gt;(McMurray &amp;amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 453)&lt;/a&gt;. In May of 2010, Tunisie en Blanc (Tunisia in White)—a peaceful demonstration against Internet censorship—was organized via Facebook and Twitter and called for people to &amp;quot;dress in white and have coffee on the avenue&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#chomiak&quot;&gt;(Chomiak &amp;amp; Entelis, 2013, pp. 1299-1301)&lt;/a&gt;. Though individually unsuccessful, movements such as these are credited as being a foundation upon which the 2010 riots could eventually succeed. The people had begun to rediscover their voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of social media in the Tunisian uprisings was aided by the fact that the country has one of the highest rates of Internet and mobile phone penetration in the region. The revolt in Tunisia came to be referred to as the first “Twitter revolution,” as citizens documented the regime&amp;#39;s violence, disseminated that information, and then coordinated protests through the network. Union workers went on strike, and over two million Tunisians changed their Facebook profiles to say, &amp;quot;Ben Ali dégage!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Ben Ali, leave!&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#chomiak&quot;&gt;(Chomiak &amp;amp; Entelis, 2013, p. 1266)&lt;/a&gt; and Al Jazeera covered the revolts and developed a program to allow mobile phones to collect to its satellite. Anonymous&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Operation Tunisia&amp;quot; took down Ben Ali&amp;#39;s website as well as other government sites. The ability with which citizens united and coordinated their message was undoubtedly facilitated by social media tools, but the experience gained from organized movements of the past was imperative to their efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;January 2011&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Tunisia found their voice, and with it they made their message clear: they demanded the removal of the regime, freedom from oppression and corruption, and dignity. But Ben Ali still failed to understand their message. Showing just how out-of-touch he was with his subjects, he offered to stop censoring sites like YouTube in an attempt to placate protestors on January 13th &lt;a href=&quot;#marzouki&quot;&gt;(Marzouki, 2013, p. 604)&lt;/a&gt;. On January 14th, after the military turned against him, refusing to fire on protestors, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who wish to oppress others do so by instilling fear—of terrorism, the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;, or the regime itself—and by promoting division among the &amp;quot;rank and file.&amp;quot; Tunisia&amp;#39;s history provides us with a rich example of the power that finding common ground or a cause to unite behind can wield. We are increasingly interconnected through the use of technology (like social media) and should use it to learn from and support each other. Finally, &amp;quot;one-size-fits-all&amp;quot; development tactics are unlikely to succeed. Privatization and globalization of markets may help an economy legitimately thrive where inclusive institutions exist, but they&amp;#39;re likely to promote corruption and increase the gap between the rich and the poor if extractive institutions exist. Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://whynationsfail.com/blog/2012/5/1/who-are-the-extractive-elites.html&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more on that subject.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;The people want the fall of the regime&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year old Tunisian fruit vendor, set himself on fire in a final act of protest after being harassed and beaten by the police. This action, which took place on December 17, 2010, is viewed as the spark that ignited a revolutionary movement. People took to the streets in opposition to the dictatorial regime of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, which had stripped Bouazizi and many other Tunisians of justice and dignity over the course of 23 years. YouTube and cell phone videos spread the news that others were demonstrating against the regime and made the violence of Ben Ali&amp;#39;s security forces more apparent. The people could no longer be placated by promises of economic relief. Then, after being ordered to fire on demonstrators, the military turned on Ben Ali who resigned and fled the country on January 14, 2011—less than a month after Bouazizi&amp;#39;s self immolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not two weeks after, Egypt&amp;#39;s Day of Revolt on January 25, 2011 made it clear that what was happening was the start of something bigger than a sporadic outburst of discontent; within a month, protests had also begun in Yemen, Sudan, Bahrain, and Libya. The cry heard around the world was clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام‎&lt;br&gt;
Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam&lt;br&gt;
(The people want the fall of the regime)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This message was—and continues to be—disseminated via social media channels like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter in countries such as Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. It&amp;#39;s been over four years since the initial uprisings, and the embers of emancipation are still glowing throughout the Middle East/North African (MENA) region today, though the tone and the pace of change varies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Social media&amp;#39;s role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s undeniable that social media has played a role in the MENA uprisings, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; role it has played is still a matter of debate. Some posit that social media was the driver behind the revolutions while others argue that it was only a component in a much more complex system and an echo of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project intends to further inspect the relationship(s) between social media and the revolutions of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya as some of the first countries impacted by this movement. I will review the background of these countries to see which factors may have contributed to the uprisings. Then, I&amp;#39;ll assess public analyses of social media&amp;#39;s historic role in the movements as well as its current function in the three countries. Finally, I&amp;#39;ll consider the status of the governments&amp;#39; democratic efforts to date. Each of these topics will be addressed by country in individual blog posts, so there will be three background posts—one for Tunisia, one for Egypt, and one for Libya—and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya&amp;#39;s histories and the assessment of their present-day situations will be used to better understand what makes a revolutionary movement—particularly one involving social media—take hold more effectively in some places than in others. A more comprehensive perspective on the role of social media in conflict is of significant importance today as governments fund research programs that &amp;quot;model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#ahmed&quot;&gt;(Ahmed, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;, develop software that spread propaganda via social media &lt;a href=&quot;#fielding&quot;&gt;(Fielding &amp;amp; Cobain, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;, and as political entities use social media to recruit &lt;a href=&quot;#bleiberg&quot;&gt;(Bleiberg &amp;amp; West, 2014)&lt;/a&gt; or to further incite conflict &lt;a href=&quot;#finighan&quot;&gt;(Finighan, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an understatement to say that treating social media as a cure-all without any side effects is dangerous; governmental and non-governmental institutions alike must be sure to consider the potential repercussions. For instance, a recent study found that social media could cause desensitization rather than motivation during times of increased violence &lt;a href=&quot;#georgia-institute-tech&quot;&gt;(“Drug war violence in Mexico connected with desensitization in social media,” 2014)&lt;/a&gt;. Inasmuch as social media can be used to combat terrorism, it can also be used to promote terrorism &lt;a href=&quot;#hui&quot;&gt;(Hui, 2010)&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, social media is a double-edged sword that can be wielded by and against the enemy&lt;a href=&quot;#kirchner&quot;&gt;(Kirchner, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;Arab Spring&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West has dubbed the revolutions of the MENA region the &amp;quot;Arab Spring,&amp;quot; which might suggest that the movement is primarily focused on a democratic transition or &amp;quot;democratic blooming,&amp;quot; but Maytha Alhassen, one of the editors of &lt;em&gt;Demanding Dignity: Young Voices from the Front Lines of the Arab Revolutions&lt;/em&gt; pointed out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/maytha-alhassen/please-reconsider-arab-sp_b_1268971.html?&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;quot;what is going on in the MENA is something deeper than a democratic transformation, it is what democracy is predicated on—a demand for recognizing the right to human dignity.&amp;quot; Further to this point, the editors of &lt;em&gt;Demanding Dignity: Young Voices from the Front Lines of the Arab Revolutions&lt;/em&gt; noted: &amp;quot;as we began to solicit essays from high-profile figures and grassroots activists, we discovered that our call for stories for a book on the &amp;#39;Arab Spring&amp;#39; fell on deaf ears&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#dignity&quot;&gt;(Alhassen &amp;amp; Shihab-Eldin, 2012, p. 4282)&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the terms &lt;em&gt;uprisings&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Arab awakening&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;revolutions&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;revolutionary movements&lt;/em&gt; were most prevalent, but &amp;quot;the unifying theme across all these revolutions was karama, dignity&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;#dignity&quot;&gt;(Alhassen &amp;amp; Shihab-Eldin, 2012, p. 4292)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to better align with the focus and intent of those participating in the movements in the Middle East and North Africa, future posts will primarily refer to the regional events of this project as the Arab uprisings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Next up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backgrounds of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya will each be discussed in separate posts. See &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/arab-uprisings/summary&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
