  <h1 class="page-title">Israel-Palestine Conflict</h1>
  <p><em>Written and researched by Haytham Amin, Danielle Crosser, Brittney Cunningham-Miller, and Elisabeth Gray as part of a group project.</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of identity, based on a land of shared history over thousands of years for both Arabs and Jews. The Zionist movement started in the early 1880s and escalated with anti-Semitic activity in Europe and Russia. The migration aggravated tension between Arabs and Jews as each struggled to establish or maintain their legitimacy in the region. Ethnic and budding nationalistic standpoints further exacerbated the conflict. Today, the issue pulls all involved parties into a battle between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; with the use of derisive and divisive language, such as &quot;terrorist&quot; and &quot;occupier.&quot; Before a resolution to the dispute can be attained, the interested parties must reflect on and address the language that has evolved with the conflict. The failure to recognize one another as humans in need of a distinct identity has diminished all efforts toward peace. A collective effort toward better and less propagandized language and understanding of one another needs to occur before a longstanding solution can be attained.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><center>
<em>&quot;The Zionist project of forging a link between the contemporary Jewish community and the land of Palestine was a project of extraordinary remaking: of language, of place and relation to it, and of selves and identities&quot; (Peteet, 2005, p. 158).</em>
</center></p>

<p>The Ottomans controlled the area of Palestine for over 400 years prior to the late 19th century. The first Jewish settlers arrived in 1880 with the goal of reclaiming Zion, the Biblically established Jewish Holy Land. Zionism and subsequent Arab nationalism were the impetuses of forming independent opposing national identities.In 1905, Arab nationalist Najib Azouri wrote _The Awakening of the Arab Nation; _two movements were now simultaneously working for claim over the land (NPR: The Mideast: A Century of Conflict: Part 1). By November 1913, tensions finally exploded in Jerusalem in what became known as the &quot;language war.&quot;</p>

<p>In December 1917, Jerusalem came under British rule, and the Ottomans fled the city after looting and attacking the people. The two forces—Jewish and Arab—had become even more intense in the wake of the war&#39;s outbreak. The start of significant conflict between Arabs and Jews was around the time of the British Mandate, which officially began in 1920 (Marcus, 2007, loc. 156).</p>

<p>Zionism and Arab nationalism fed off of miscommunication and prejudice that turned into a dispute over land each could claim as their own. Episodes of violence and conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine were common, especially in the 1920s and 1930s. Arab fears over the increasing pace of Jewish immigration and land purchases in Palestine played a significant role in the unrest (Marcus, 2007, loc. 392). The implementation of the &quot;Hebrew labor only&quot; policy triggered violent protest in the Arab Riots of 1920 and the Arab Revolt of 1936– 1939 (Tucker &amp; Roberts, 2008).</p>

<p>The Mandate ended with the outbreak of the first Arab-Israeli war, which Israelis call the War of Independence and Palestinians call Al Naqba, or &quot;The Disaster.&quot; This began after the announcement of the creation of the modern state of Israel in 1948 (Marcus, 2007, loc. 159).</p>

<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

<h3>Interested Parties</h3>

<p>Today there are several parties entangled in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, each having a different objective, which heightens the complexity of the dispute. The persecution of Jews that occurred in European states and Russia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries spurred the Jewish people&#39;s efforts to establish an independent state that could provide them with protection (Tucker &amp; Roberts, 2008). Israeli Jews maintain that their history and cultural identity is based in part upon their existence in the Promised Land, now the state of Israel (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74). Bekerman notes that &quot;&#39;conceptions of identity&#39; are the key building blocks of the most universal of modern structures and ideologies&quot; and that they are products of exclusionary power relations&quot; (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74). Such exclusionary power relations likely contributed to the Palestinian intifada. Unsurprisingly, Israeli Jewish interests in the conflict include the establishment of peace, reduction of terrorist activity and recognition of Israel by the Palestinians and Arab world.</p>

<p>The parties most directly impacted by exclusionary power relations are Israeli Arabs and Palestinians. Israeli Arabs feel that they are treated as lesser citizens and ultimately seek equal political representation and rights, along with improved socio-economic and education opportunities. Moreover, they call for the removal of institutional discrimination (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74). Palestinians demand the withdrawal of Israeli occupation in the region to the boundaries of 1967, with all deportees and refugees having the right to return to Palestine and their homes or villages. They also call for a stop to the building of new Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, and the freeing of all Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p>The Arab League is an outspoken supporter of the Palestinians, demanding the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories up to the lines of 4 June 1967 and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, which they maintain could peacefully coexist side-by-side with the state of Israel. Further requests include the dismantling of the separation wall on the West Bank and all settlements including those in East Jerusalem, resumed assistance to the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, and the lifting of all sanctions (Fifth Meeting of High Officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Arab and South American Countries, 2008).</p>

<p>The United States is Israel&#39;s greatest ally. It has participated continuously in efforts toward peace between Israel, Palestine, and the rest of the Arab region. It&#39;s invested interests lie in the economic, military, and social partnerships that they wish to develop and maintain in the region (United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (H.R. 938), 2014).</p>

<p>Hamas&#39;s 1988 charter calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and for the maintenance of the Islamic nature of Palestine. In the past decade, however, the group has been &quot;moving further and further away from the articles of its own charter&quot; (Eldar, 2014). Hamas has most recently focused on demands for the opening of borders and freedom of movement for Gazan residents and of the Rafah crossing. They have also called for the release of Palestinian prisoners and the expansion of the area that Gazan fishermen are allowed to sail within (Hamas, Palestinian Authority list demands for Israel-Gaza cease-fire - Diplomacy and Defense Israel News, 2014). Further, they have requested that the Israeli government enable freedom of movement for Palestinians currently living within restricted corridors, including agricultural areas along established borders (Hamas Charter 1988, 1988). Fatah wants to establish a unified government with Hamas (Fatah and Hamas agree on new Palestinian prime minister, 2014) and a Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as their capital (Palestinian rivals: Fatah &amp; Hamas, 2013). Lastly, Egypt wants border stability and peace in the region, a reduced flow of illegal traffic through the tunnel systems at its borders, and protection of Palestinians (Council on Foreign Relations &amp; Laub, 2013).</p>

<h3>Attempted Solutions</h3>

<p>The conflict thus far has been addressed by providing two-state, single state and three state solutions, none of which have been successful to date (BBC Reconsidering the Two State Solution, 2013; Beneath the conflict in Gaza lies the death of the two-state solution, 2014). The most crucial factor that is necessary for a resolution is that of &quot;structural change—the immediate halt of state-practiced systematic discrimination in all areas, including land dispossession and allocation, housing, economics, culture, political participation, and education&quot; (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74).</p>

<p>Palestinian and Arab organizations maintain that Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories up to the lines of 4 June 1967 if an agreement is to be established (Fifth Meeting of High Officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Arab and South American Countries, 2008). This has been a major point of contention, as it directly conflicts with Israel&#39;s recent actions and interests. The obvious consequences of not solving the problem are increased violence, continued instability in the region, and the reduction of democratic options in the area. Potential for developmental growth in the region is also diminished.</p>

<h3>Institutional Arrangements</h3>

<p>Institutional arrangements (both locally and internationally), including significant socio-political divisions between Jews and Palestinians, have sustained the problems. The construct of social identity is a product of power relations; these relations are established through split hierarchies—the powerful are considered to be essential while the weak are delegitimized (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74). As the actions and beliefs of the &quot;other&quot; are delegitimized, the members of that group have been defined as the enemy, which further escalates the conflict (Bar-Tal, 2013).</p>

<p>Extremist groups in the Middle East have been gaining traction and also complicate efforts toward peace between Palestinians and Israelis (Mandel, 2014). Israel identifies Hamas as an extremist group and has stated that they will not negotiate with the Palestinian Authority if it is under the control of Hamas (Fatah and Hamas agree on new Palestinian prime minister, 2014). Additionally, ISIL has grown as a terrorist threat—it has recruited thousands of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria from across the globe and leveraged technology to spread its violent extremist ideology and to incite others to commit terrorist acts (Melham, 2014).</p>

<p>Israel also sees Iran as a legitimate threat to its existence. The government has expressed concern that the new front that the U.S is leading against ISIL will interfere with the Iran negotiations, saying, &quot;Iran&#39;s nuclear program ought to come before the new war&quot; (Beaumont, 2014).</p>

<h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>

<p>The greatest strength of the region lies in the fact that Israel-Palestine is home to a common history that is shared by multiple religions and maintains the world&#39;s attention both economically and politically. Its weaknesses, however, are based on the diversity of the population, which has focused primarily on its differences. Accusations of cultural insensitivity and divisions by ethnic and national group identities (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74) exacerbate tensions. &quot;Us and them&quot; mentality, which is accomplished through &quot;myth-making&quot; idealizes one&#39;s own group and demonizes others (Zembylas, 2008, p. 1-17). To this point, Sucharov reminds us, &quot;we need to remember that the notions of &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;barbaric&quot; have always been synonyms for &quot;us&quot; and &#39;them&#39;&quot; (Sucharov, 2014).</p>

<p>The opportunities in this conflict can be found in future generations. A focus on peace and religious tolerance in education could improve relations between future generations. Bekerman speaks to this point, noting that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>young children...not yet fully socialized into the historical realities that gave birth to the conflict, seem not to hold to an understanding of identity as a boundary marker, especially not one that entirely delimits their spheres of social contact...in conflict-ridden societies, if youth are educated within a master narrative that maintains a state of intractable group identities and negative interdependence by which the assertion of one group&#39;s identity requires negating the identity of the other, the possibility for a truly transcendent, peace-promoting, educational experience seems unlikely (Bekerman, 2009, p. 74).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, focusing on establishing equal political rights may be a good preliminary step to determining how political boundaries are established in the future. Lustick suggests &quot;the issue is no longer where to draw political boundaries between Jews and Arabs on a map but how equality of political rights is to be achieved&quot; (Lustick, 2014). Many groups and organizations are working to improve the quality of life in the region in accordance with the UN&#39;s Declaration of Human Rights (The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948).</p>

<p>The most significant threats to peace in the region are related to communication struggles. Peteet warns that, &quot;in a conflict setting, the words chosen from a vast lexicon to describe events, actions, peoples, places and social phenomena reverberate with, uphold or contest power&quot; (Peteet, 2005, p. 154). Many of the tensions between Jews and Arabs have grown out of miscommunication—subtle and possibly unintended insults that both parties made due to their unfamiliarity with each other&#39;s language, customs, or religion (Marcus, 2008, p.91). Such hatred and distrust is perpetuated by violence, and provides room for extremist groups to take power. Violence, in many cases, is simply an act of desperation—&quot;Whereas many if not most al-Qaeda mujahidun come to movements from afar, often leaving their home countries to join jihads in foreign lands, the use of violence by Hamas is born almost entirely out of a sense of desperation, a belief that no other tactics of resistance are viable within the context of an ongoing occupation of their own land&quot; (LeVine, 2008, pp. 141-142).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The conflict between Palestine and Israel has proven itself to be one of the most complicated issues of the modern age. Many have suggested that it is impossible. A two-state solution still may be viable, but before an agreement of that nature can be made, more basic efforts must be made to lessen the combative stance that both sides have assumed toward each other. In order for a longstanding solution between Palestinians and Israelis to be accomplished, a focus on the language used in discourse has to be addressed. They must make efforts to achieve a better understanding of one another; this can be more easily accomplished if both parties have an equal voice and representation in the conflict.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>All involved parties must pay special attention to the language used when proposing solutions. For example, in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, nomenclature has been used to assert control or ownership over contested areas—&quot;colonial and imperial adventures describe subjugated areas as under-utilising their resources, in need of democracy, or as threats to world peace&quot; (Peteet, 2005, p. 155).</p>

<p>The names used for locations and monuments within the region function as public claims, and the repetition of those names serve a political purpose, displacing previous titles and normalizing the new. These words and titles—both old and new—are a reflection of self and of identity. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, naming can be &quot;a diagnostic of power; conflicts over naming reflect and are integral to contests over control and ownership. Each party tries to superimpose its name over territory, places, actions and interpretations of events. Whose nomenclature prevails derives from the ability to have one&#39;s narration and lexicon accepted as the standard one&quot; (Peteet, 2005, p. 157). In order to escape this, Israel and Palestine need to find a way to plan for peace in terms of a third shared space, an identity of &quot;we,&quot; rather than that of either Israel (&quot;us&quot;) and Palestine (&quot;them&quot;). Forming an inclusive identity of &#39;Palestine/Israel&#39; &quot;implies recognition of both parties&#39; claims to and presence in the same geographic space&quot; (Peteet, 2005, p. 166).</p>

<h3>Voice</h3>

<p>In order for any efforts toward establishing a collective &quot;we&quot; to succeed, the gaps between Jews and Palestinians in the region must be improved through the establishment of equal political rights and representation—&quot;plus&quot; and &quot;minus&quot; statuses must be removed. Peteet spoke to this problem, noting &quot;the real dispute has always been over speech, over the language of discourse, and not over the identity of the speakers. That&#39;s why the Israelis seem to be saying that only territorialized states can speak and negotiate; the Palestinians are stateless, so they cannot speak, let alone negotiate&quot; (Peteet, 2005, p. 162). This goal is not likely to be accomplished without outside intervention. Israel and Palestine would need to align with or establish peace-seeking institutions—educational, cultural, religious, and political—as a means to promote greater cultural understanding. Religious and cultural literacy are necessary components of peace efforts. Organizations such as the Mennonite Central Committee have succeeded in this regard by &quot;empowering local actors and helping them develop effective, culturally legitimate practices&quot; (Seidel, 2012, pp. 424-441).</p>

<p>Seidel noted that the problem of development is the problem of knowledge—&quot;it is a problem of discovering other ways of knowing, being and doing. It is a problem of how to be human in ways other than those of Europe&quot; (Seidel, 2012, pp. 424-441). The same concept can be applied to the situation in Israel-Palestine. History has shown that Jews and Arabs can coexist. The struggle now is in determining how peace can be accomplished after years of propagandizing each other&#39;s differences and reiterating that coexistence is impossible.</p>

<p>At its base, the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis is one of identities, and language has a significant role in the promotion of peace or of violence. You have to change the way that you talk about conflict before you can change the way you think about it. Once you change the way you think about it, you can begin to come up with ways to actually find common ground and, ultimately, peace.</p>
