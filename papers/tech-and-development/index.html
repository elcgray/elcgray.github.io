  <h1 class="page-title">Technology and Development</h1>
  <p>Technology&#39;s presence in development has been consistent although perspectives on the role and relationship between the two have shifted throughout history. Some of the founders of the United States such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson viewed the pursuit of science and technology for the betterment and prosperity of humankind as the drive behind progress (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, p. 3). Others such as Alexander Hamilton and Tench Coxe viewed technology as an independent driving force in society, aligning themselves with the views of technological determinism (Smith and Marx, 1994, p. 4). In 2000, Castells posited that technology <em>is</em> society (Castells, 2000, p.5) and Heeks expressed a similar view, stating that &quot;economic, social, and political life in the 21st century will be increasingly digital, and those without information and communication technologies (ICTs) will be increasingly excluded&quot; (Heeks, 2008, p. 26) making development without technology practically infeasible.</p>

<p>Winner details the relationship between technology and society in a different light, conjuring up images aligned with Philip K. Dick&#39;s depictions of the future. He suggests that the technologies we once used as tools have become a part of our humanity, deeply interwoven into our existence (Winner, 1986, p. 12) and that the very concepts that humans are comprised of--relationships, morals, habits, ideas, politics--have been completely restructured due to modern technological development (Winner, 1986, p. 9). James Smith has a less severe take on technology&#39;s role, asserting that development is about improving lives and fulfilling wants and needs, but he emphasizes the need for the study of development technology&#39;s past effects on the world when determining how to utilize it in the future (Smith, 2009, p. 10). He cites the UN Millennium Report on Science and Technology for Development when reinforcing his view that technology today is the determining factor that drives development (Smith, 2009, p. 16). He warns, though, that our bold visions of modernity put us at risk of overlooking what&#39;s actually wanted (and needed) by those we&#39;re trying to assist (Smith, 2009, p. 36).</p>

<p>Smith and Marx suggest that technology&#39;s role in development was established when it began to be viewed as a liberating force from oppression during the Age of Enlightenment (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, pp. 2-3) and that the ideology of technology as a driving force in human history had fully established itself by the end of the 1800s (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, p. 7). From there, it was only logical that the power and progress that technology embodied would elevate its status in development to that of a solution to the world&#39;s ailments (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, p. 8). By the 1900s, the modern world worshipped at the foot of Technology. Its citizens attributed their success and wellbeing to technological advancements and committed themselves to promoting the salvation of backward, &quot;traditional&quot; societies through their development efforts (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, pp. 13-23).</p>

<p>Concerns about the unintended consequences accompanying the use of technology in development are prevalent, and there is, undoubtedly, reason for such concern. One needs only to consider the accidents at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island or Fukushima Daiichi to see that there are often aspects of development whose consequences are not anticipated when introducing new technology to society. It&#39;s easy to point to accidents such as these when illustrating the dangers that technology can introduce to society in the name of development. Technological advancements pursued with abandon despite criticism worldwide are of even greater concern. This behavior suggests that our desire for the stabilization of, or control over, an environment we&#39;re unfamiliar with has superseded the logic—the humanity, even—that is necessary to be successful in human development efforts. A clear example of this is the increasingly prevalent use of drones in war.</p>

<p>News regarding the use drones as tools of war (and, consequently, as agents of American development efforts) exposes mixed results and reactions to their increasing use. Television shows such as Homeland (&quot;Learn More About Homeland and the Cast of Homeland - Showtime.&quot;) depict a drone strike gone wrong as being a driving factor behind an American soldier&#39;s turn to terrorism. The New York Times recently focused on drone strikes in Yemen, questioning the efficacy of such a campaign after the accidental killing of a vocal opponent to Al Qaeda during a drone strike, stating, &quot;The killing of Mr. Jaber, just the kind of leader most crucial to American efforts to eradicate Al Qaeda, was a reminder of the inherent hazards of the quasi-secret campaign of targeted killings that the United States is waging against suspected militants not just in Yemen but also in Pakistan and Somalia&quot; (Worth, Mazzetti &amp; Shane, 2013).</p>

<p>The increased use of drones could be seen as being aligned with what Mumford described as mankind&#39;s evolution from user of technology to conquer nature to user of technology to detach from nature (Mumford, 1967, p. 3). It also reinforces his belief that we are moving steadily toward a passive and purposeless existence as part of the &quot;megamachine&quot; (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, p. 29). Ellul&#39;s haunting observation on the melding of man and the machine, the mechanization our methods, our thoughts and our practices (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, pp. 30-31) also deserves more attention on this topic. Tim Blackmore describes the Tactile Situation Awareness System (TSAS), a vest worn by drone pilots, explaining that, &quot;the TSAS unloads the brain but extends the human by literally putting more pressure on the body. The body is slaved to the machine: What ills the machine feels, the human must interpret and adjust for. The machine does not help the human, except by removing the human from the battlefield; and in exchange, the human becomes a new kind of drone in the network. The drive toward telepresence, for the user to simultaneously be at the scene yet not in danger, picks up speed. Early drones were programmed before launch, then flew, ditched, stayed on course, returned, or did not&quot; (Blackmore, 2005, p. 207) Winner&#39;s statement that, &quot;We do not use technologies as much as live them&quot; (Smith &amp; Marx, 1994, p. 32), rings true in this instance and is a clear warning against passivity and disregard for the consequences of the technological changes, such as the use of drones, that are deployed into the world. Winner presented John Glenn&#39;s lack of emotion upon seeing the Earth from orbit for the first time as an example, concluding that the &quot;synthetic conditions generated in the training center had begun to seem more &#39;real&#39; than the actual experience&quot; (Winner, 1986, p. 3). One could argue that this same effect is taking place today in our homes with the introduction of convincingly more lifelike entertainment experiences such as video games and movies. We can better express how we &quot;feel&quot; by sharing YouTube clips, emoticons or animated GIFs than we can utilize our words as means of communications.</p>

<p>Blackmore, in a description of the need for and the state of entertainment, delivers a message eerily similar to Winner and Ellul&#39;s forecasts, stating</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once full of meaning composed of ritual (human activities that undergird community) grounded in natural patterns (changing seasons and their attendant cycles), life is now divorced from the reality of the harvest or spring, times of plenty, and renewal. High-speed entertainments that mimic life are the new interim filler for those confronting the abyss. Because such material needs to be produced incessantly and in mass quantities, the film industry is as much a machine as the machines needed to create films themselves: all these interconnected devices support the ruling societal worldview (Blackmore, 2012, p. 296).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To this point, he notes that Ellul considered the propaganda generated to reinforce a particular viewpoint or action (such as the United States&#39; wars in the Middle East) to be a necessary part of &quot;the technological society&quot; and further asserted that, as citizens of the machine age, we are in need of &quot;regular emotional replenishment&quot; in order to keep working since our work is now devoid of the craft, love and satisfaction that jobs used to have (Blackmore, 2012, p. 296). To this effect, one can see clearly that there aremany unintended consequences that may come with the introduction of technology into development practices, but that isn&#39;t to say that the use of technology isn&#39;t worthwhile.</p>

<p>Winner viewed technology as a political phenomenon that favors the views and interests of those in power, and it&#39;s during his explanation of that view that he comes closest to proposing a solution to passivity and disregard for others. He emphasized the need for society to actively consider whether or not the technological changes desired are compatible with the common good before bringing them into existence (Winner, 1986 ,pp. 55-56). During an interview about her artwork on violence, artist Krista Wortendyke was asked if she thought that, in a time where some say that Americans are their own greatest threat, we can &quot;move forward as human beings to create this global collective and have respect for one another and mankind.&quot; She responded by saying, &quot;I don&#39;t like that this question implies that human nature is different now than it was then. It posits that the Internet may enable us to solve the world&#39;s problems and it presumes that Americans are the unique holders of this ability. My simple answer is this. It&#39;s behavior we need to change; it&#39;s whole mindsets and attitudes we need to change. We, as humans, seem to be able to have extreme compassion for those that we know personally, but are totally incapable of empathizing with someone that we&#39;ve never met&quot; (An Innate Drive to Explore Ideas, 2013).</p>

<p>The use of technology as a means of sterilizing our interactions with others to make exchanges simpler or less inconvenient dehumanizes and reduces the efficacy of our development efforts. Human interaction—conflict, negotiation and resolution-making—are what make us supremely different from the technology we employ. Lieutenant Matthew Hipple proclaimed that, &quot;Where machines feel no fury, they also show neither pity nor doubt,&quot; with this in mind, he also acknowledged that &quot;Humans will always be needed in the loop, especially on the ground when dealing with populations (Hipple, 2012, p. 7).&quot; It is through these human interactions that we learn from each other and evolve. Patrick McCormick warned that we risk surrendering the very humanity that makes us hate war, warning &quot;Everyone wants to protect our troops; but if we can kill the enemy without suffering casualties, will we kill less often, or more? If our pilots and soldiers learn to kill by remote control, and our citizens believe an army of robots will absorb most of the costs we pay in combat, will we lose our sense of war&#39;s horror? If fewer of our boys and girls are dying, will we think no one is dying (McCormick, 2005, p. 48)?&quot;</p>

<p>We, as humans, must make changes in our behaviors, mindsets and attitudes in order to effectively apply technology to development issues and to best avoid negative consequences. In response to Winner&#39;s assertion that there is no philosophy of technology (Winner, 1986, p. 4), it can be asserted that we need to begin to develop the basis for a technological philosophy. Mumford led such a charge, stating, &quot;if we do not take the time to review the past we shall not have sufficient insight to understand the present or command the future: for the past never leaves us, and the future is already here&quot; (Mumford, 1967, p. 13). The &quot;future&quot; integrates itself ever more closely into our present-day lives as we advance technologically. That is why it is even more important now that we must learn from past mistakes and choose not to use technology solely for the sake of technology and ask ourselves, &quot;Is the intelligence alone, however purified and decontaminated, an adequate agent for doing justice to the needs and purposes of life (Mumford, 1967, p. 288)?&quot; It is easy to try and simplify humanity, but it is not accurate or beneficial to our growth.We must learn from past &quot;articulation errors&quot; (Castells, 2001, p. 178) when considering what is desired and what is available. It is equally important to consider a balanced approach between computer science, information science and development studies like that proposed by Heeks, asking ourselves not only what is possible but what is feasible and desirable with technology (Heeks, 2008, p. 32).</p>

<p>With the globalization of the world, we are offered a unique opportunity to learn from our neighbors, to hybridize (Smith, 2009, pp. 35-36) our methods and approaches to development instead of dictating solutions to other parts of the world from our isolated Western perspective and to create new technological/societal interactions. This implies that there will be no single solution to development needs, and that the specific solution applied must be context-bound. Development strategies must be designed around the specific resources, capacities and demands present (Heeks, 2008, p. 32) for that community, and the historic and cultural roots of the people must be taken into careful consideration. James Smith touched on the importance of this, expressing a &quot;need to consider ways in which to ground our understanding of technology and development in real life, in local settings and interactions…we need to understand how people encounter technologies that may well have been developed in entirely different contexts and sometimes for entirely different purposes&quot; (Smith, 2009, pp.31-31). To this point, Sherine Ghoneim and Cheryl Brown argued that &quot;even the more ubiquitous ICTs are beyond some African people&#39;s reach, with millions never having made a telephone call…An argument was made for technology to be used to facilitate the way people already work rather than be the means by which a new way of working is imposed&quot; (Ghoneim &amp; Brown, 2011, p. 230) Though millions in Africa may have never made a telephone call, mobile phones are no longer perceived to be a luxury item, and phone technology is increasingly more powerful (Labbé, 2011, p.19). To that end, the use of mobile phones for disease surveillance and the provision of other public services (Léautier, 2011, p. 142) is an approach that seems to be gaining more ground in Africa. M-Pesa, for instance, is a Kenyan mobile banking service that has arisen due to parts of the population being unable to access traditional banks (Labbé, 2011, p. 20) and a group named Text to Change uses text messages to improve Ugandans&#39; awareness of HIV treatment and prevention (Karrer-Rueedi &amp; Trueb, 2011, p. 15).</p>

<p>Finally, when applying technology to development strategies, it is important not to assume that the presence of technology is a solution in and of itself. Training and ongoing involvement are integral to the successful implementation of technological solutions. Blignaut expounds upon this point, stating that,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Training opportunities need to be tailored to suit the special needs of people from disadvantaged communities. The unique limitations of each individual, whether physical, psychological or educational, must be taken into account when designing training programs. These programs must include short-term goals so that participants can experience immediate, positive outcomes on their commitment. This will ensure that they stay motivated with a growing desire to learn more. Intrinsic psychological stumbling blocks, such as computer anxiety, must also be addressed through carefully designed training programs that will create satisfying and enjoyable experiences. It is clear, therefore, that only providing access to the millions in South Africa will not be sufficient. In order to foster the strategic use of the Internet to satisfy specific needs, these people will need education, as well as opportunities to improve their lifestyle and socio-economic status (Blignaut, 2009, p. 598).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commitment to education and training that&#39;s designed with the specific needs of the people involved is critical. It&#39;s with this focus in mind that development and technology can be combined to engage and empower those in need.</p>
