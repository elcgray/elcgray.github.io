  <p><center><em>&quot;When every one is dead the Great Game is finished. Not before.&quot;</em> </center>
<center><em>(Kipling, 2011, p. 288)</em></center></p>

<h2>The Great Game</h2>

<h3>Beginnings</h3>

<p>The Great Game, as it was coined, came about during the power struggle between Britain and Russia that began in the early 19th century. Afghanistan was the focal point for both countries due to existing investments in the region but also because of its importance for trade and communication routes through Asia. The struggle between Britain and Russia for control over the territory of Afghanistan continued into the early 20th century and resulted in a country that had been torn apart by war and the ebb and flow of different regimes. This history of both internal and external strife in Afghanistan continues today, though the United States&#39; involvement in the country is still fairly new.</p>

<h3>Little America</h3>

<p>The War on Terror wasn&#39;t the United States&#39; first foray into Afghanistan. Prior to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the US would align with Afghanistan&#39;s urban elite, many of whom were educated in the West, in an attempt to modernize the country (and steer it away from communist influence) with the help of US contractors as they built Lashkar Gar, known as Little America to the Afghans. This modernization effort ultimately failed, and the US provided Afghanistan with loans to help them recover from the mistakes that were made by both sides during the process (Chandrasekaran, 2011). Chandrasekaran asserted in his account of Little America that</p>

<p>All of the principal challenges of the Little America project - the tension between modernists and traditionalists, the incompetence and venality of contractors, the inability of the Afghans to fulfill their end of the deal, the unrealistic expectations of American and Afghan officials - are the same reasons that today&#39;s grand nation-building effort is so troubled...The U.S. government has again sided with the country&#39;s urban elite instead of seeking to empower local and tribal leaders. It did so in the name of good governance, but it has weakened the grass-roots leadership essential to building stability (Chandrasekaran, 2011).</p>

<h3>The Fall of Communism</h3>

<p>After the Soviet Union fell, the United States was left standing as the sole superpower of the Cold War. Barbara Falk noted in her article on post-Cold War policymaking that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those in the democracy promotion industry in the United States were quick to pick up on a key lesson from 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe: critical to the creation and consolidation of democracy is the development of civil society. Applying 1989 to the Middle East in this respect meant adopting a number of key and, as it turns out, highly contestable assumptions: (1) external support for civil society necessarily and logically helps end tyranny worldwide; (2) as during the Cold War, containment alone is not the answer; (3) peoples of the world innately desire freedom; and (4) that freedom translates into an US-friendly version of democratic citizenship (Falk, 2009, p. 302).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She further posited that the resultant triumphalism &quot;generated a sweeping vision for democratization in the Middle East&quot; that was only further exacerbated by 9/11 (Falk, 2009, p. 291). Matthew Hill reinforces the assertion that democracy promotion has become an essential component of US foreign policy since the fall of Communism, but he emphasized that this did not keep the US from supporting oppressive, undemocratic regimes if it was in the nation&#39;s interest (Hill, 2012, p. 10).</p>

<h3>The War on Terror</h3>

<p>After the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the United States entered a new phase in its relationship with Afghanistan. Identified as the central location and breeding ground for terrorist cells such as al Qaeda, the United States quickly set its sights on the country and its goals on the elimination of al Qaeda and Taliban forces within it. With al Qaeda identified as enemy number one and the Bonn Accords signed, the US and its allies expanded both their military and their civilian presence inside of Afghanistan (Rubin, 2013, p. 171).</p>

<p>By 2003, the assault within Afghanistan against al Qaeda and the Taliban had been completed, and the US set its sights on Iraq with the War on Terror. Rubin notes in this regard that &quot;the undifferentiated image of the &quot;fundamentalist terrorist&quot; seemed at this point to be replacing that of the &quot;Soviet-inspired communist&quot; (or, in Moscow, &quot;American imperialist&quot;) as the enemy image of our time&quot; (Rubin, 2013, p. 74). The US expected the brunt of post-conflict stabilization in Afghanistan to be managed by its allies and international organizations (Paris, 2013, p.539). The &quot;peacebuilding regime&quot; that spawned after the Cold War would begin its plight to establish democracy, good governance policies, the rule of law and other reforms within the country as it recovered from conflict (Paris, 2013, p. 539).</p>

<h2>US Development Efforts</h2>

<h3>Conflict and Development in Afghanistan</h3>

<p>Rubin summarized what the U.S. inherited with its involvement in Afghanistan when he noted that &quot;the war is not a civil war but a transnational one&quot; (Paris, 2013, p. 27). To this point, he noted that &quot;because the country has never produced enough wealth to pay the cost of governing or defending itself, Afghanistan has been stable only when its neighbors or imperial powers agreed to strengthen it as a buffer or nonaligned state to serve external security interests&quot; (Paris, 2013, p. 236). When the United States and its allies succeeded at pushing al Qaeda and the Taliban out of Afghanistan, they also broke down the country&#39;s existing governing structure. Consequently, they and the international community inherited the responsibility of stabilizing the country since the alternative would likely result in even greater instability across the region, which would in turn spawn more terrorist activity.</p>

<p>US development concerns were secondary to the country&#39;s efforts to eliminate the threat of further terrorist attacks by al Qaeda. When their primary goal was achieved, they began to assist in development efforts but focused predominantly on military functions such as the training of Afghan troops and stabilization efforts. By 2003, their focus on Afghanistan was split with Iraq and its alleged weapons of mass destruction, so they relied heavily on the UN and other international organizations to lead and support the process of establishing a democracy inside of Afghanistan. Democracy does, in fact, appear to be the key component of the United States&#39; development plan for countries that experience conflict.</p>

<h3>Democracy as Development</h3>

<p>Hill asserts in his book that &quot;The United States sees its mission as providential: it has been &#39;chosen&#39; to share its blessings by bringing about the reform of politics at international and domestic levels and by opposing &#39;evil&#39; throughout the world&quot; (Hill, 2012, p. 5-6). He further charged that the US has a formulaic, &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach to development and that much of the strategy used in Afghanistan is the same as that was used in Bosnia, noting that &quot;the analysis of the structural conditions of the two countries, before democracy was promoted, indicates that their respective paths to a modernised state were at completely different levels. Bosnia had the strong foundations of a modern relationship between the polity and the government, Afghanistan had never really functioned as a modern state with central government control over the whole country…Despite these differences, there was an assumption that democracy could be developed using the same strategy in each case&quot; (Hill, 2012, p. 67-68). Falk warned that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Democratization in whatever guise it is promoted—elite-driven or bottom- up—may not be the panacea that should guide antiterrorism efforts or the modernization of societies while addressing the challenges of economic development and endemic poverty and disease. Yet one conclusion is sure: democratization is certainly not a shortcut...Rich associational life can bring with it elements inimical to democratic values, which can and do foster ethnic and religious strife. Free and fair elections should be viewed as the end of the process, not the beginning, particularly as they may harden societal divisions rather than lessen them (2009, p. 310).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the great benefits of a democracy over a dictatorship or autocracy, Falk&#39;s warning bears merit in that the establishment of all of the pillars necessary for a long-lasting and stable democratic structure takes time. The World Development Report speaks to this point, noting that &quot;It is important not to confuse speed with haste in political processes: too hasty approaches can precipitate the opposite effect from the one we seek to support...Democratization efforts today, similarly, require attention to historical heritages and existing political cleavages, and must be seen as an ongoing process of social transformation and the development of a broad range of institutions that provide checks and balances rather than an identifiable &#39;event.&#39; Democratization does not start or end with elections&quot; (World Bank, 2011, p. 15).</p>

<h3>Development Expectations</h3>

<p>The World Development Report in 2011 asserted that &quot;A key lesson of successful violence prevention and recovery is that security, justice, and economic stresses are linked: approaches that try to solve them through military-only, justice-only, or development-only solutions will falter&quot; (World Bank, 2011, p. 28). In their research, they found that, though most agreed on how development efforts should be approached, there were differences of opinion in what was considered to be a realistic timeframe for the attainment of goals such as national leadership and the improvement of good governance (World Bank, 2011, p. 36-38). There was also significant discussion of the relationship between security and development needs as they pertain to human security (World Bank, 2011, p. 45), as &quot;countries and subnational areas with the weakest institutional legitimacy and governance are the most vulnerable to violence and instability and the least able to respond to internal and external stresses&quot; (World Bank, 2011, p. 7).</p>

<p>Captain Jonathan Pan&#39;s opinions align with the WDR&#39;s emphasis on the importance of security in development efforts, stating that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are significant differences between stabilization and development. According to the Department of Defense, stability operations &quot;help establish order that advances United States interests and values. The immediate goal often is to provide the local populace with security, restore essential services, and meet humanitarian needs.&quot; Development can be measured by the increase in quality of life for the average citizen. There are multiple spheres of development. Governance, healthcare, education, gender equality, infrastructure, economics, human rights, and the environment are common examples. All of those elements of development are necessary for a self-sustaining Afghanistan, but few, if any, are achieved without the precursor of stability (Pan, 2010, p. 68-69).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Captain Pan goes on to suggest that stability operations must begin by enhancing traditional systems that worked and that communities put in charge of their own development councils would provide their own &quot;sweat equity.&quot; Since they&#39;d be putting their own names on the line, he asserts, they&#39;re more likely to defend those projects, and they&#39;re less likely to be subject to Taliban vandalism and destruction. &quot;This,&quot; he says, &quot;is the definition of maintaining the initiative&quot; (Pan, 2010, p. 72-73).</p>

<h3>Development Perceptions</h3>

<p>Fromkin asserted that the U.S. has taken over Britain&#39;s role in the Great Game as it pertains to influence and interests in the Middle East and Asia (1980, p. 947). This belief seems also to be held by the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) who, believing that their cooperation on counterterrorism was being exploited for ulterior motives, asked the United States to set a date for the shutdown of its military bases in Central Asia in 2005 (Rubin, 2013, p. 237). Rubin said that some Afghans have come to believe that &quot;reform is just a charade to legitimize a Western counterterrorism agenda from which they are unlikely to benefit,&quot; (2013, p. 179) and that &quot;the United States and its coalition partners intervened in Afghanistan to protect their own security from al Qaeda, not to protect Afghanistan from al Qaeda, Taliban, the Northern Alliance, militias, drought, poverty, and debt bondage to drug traffickers&quot; (2013, p. 206).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The United States government&#39;s approach to development in zones of conflict seems to follow a formulaic approach that attempts to establish democratic governance within a prescribed timeframe as the solution to all other developmental needs. For instance, efforts in Afghanistan did not seem to be as focused on the specific needs of the people as they did on the immediate establishment of a democratic structure in place of the Taliban. However, such a structure is not likely to survive if the Afghan people don&#39;t trust the system or the leaders put in place. Rubin noted that &quot;building a national state means creating a sovereign center of political accountability, which is not necessarily the same as building an ally in the War on Terror&quot; (Rubin, 2013, p. 183-184). When &quot;communism&quot; can be replaced by &quot;terrorism&quot; as the primary focus of development efforts in areas of conflict, but the strategies implemented to address the country&#39;s needs disregard the region&#39;s history and are strikingly semblant to those of past efforts, a pattern is likely to be recognized by the recipients of such aid. As a result, the United States&#39; approach to development could be perceived as a self-serving effort to make its own citizens more secure rather than the people of the country they&#39;re helping develop.</p>
