  <p><em>The Culture of Violence in Mexico and Its Impact on Development Efforts</em>
<br /></p>

<h2>A Culture of Violence</h2>

<p>In 2011, the UNDP&#39;s administrator, Helen Clark, spoke on the issue of pervasive violence in Latin America, saying that &quot;transnational criminal organizations pose a huge threat to state security institutions whose mandate is limited to the national context...Societies and states are sometimes tempted to use illegal means to fight crime, and the public debate on insecurity can become unduly polarized (&quot;Latin America’s transition to democracy steady but violence still threatens region, UNDP chief says | UNDP&quot;, 2011).&quot; It was estimated that more than 18,000 people were murdered in <em>Central America</em> alone in 2010 (&quot;Latin America’s transition to democracy steady but violence still threatens region, UNDP chief says | UNDP&quot;, 2011). This underscores the severity of an issue that affects an entire region. However, Mexico&#39;s culture of violence has garnered a significant amount of attention in the past decade as the expanse of its reach becomes more evident. In 2011, the Los Angeles Times cited government intelligence figures stating that 40,000 people have been killed since 2006 as a result of the expanding drug war (Wilkinson, 2011); other sources near 100,000 with their estimates (Kirchner, 2014). This paper will consider whether or not there is a correlation between a culture of violence and the status of development efforts in those areas most significantly affected by conflict.</p>

<h2>Mexico Today</h2>

<h3>Organized Crime</h3>

<p>Organized crime is the most natural entity to blame for the violence and fear that maintains a stranglehold on swaths of Mexican society today. In 2013, the state of Guerrero, located in the southwest of Mexico and home to Acapulco, ranked highest in number of homicides in Mexico, and it held the second-highest number of kidnappings (Fausset, 2014). Neighboring state, Michoacán, is equally infamous for high levels of conflict and corruption at the hand of the Knights Templar. Such troubles are not isolated to the Pacific regions of Mexico, however. The state of Tamaulipas on the US-Mexican border has recently seen an increase in violence related to organized crime. In April 2014, it is reported that approximately 70 people, including a federal official and some bystanders, were killed; 17 deaths occurred in one day in the border city of Reynosa (&quot;Violence related with organized crime grows in Tamaulipas&quot;, 2014). Unfortunately, organized crime does not account for all of the violence that citizens witness.</p>

<h3>Police and Military Violence</h3>

<p>Juan Méndez, a UN Special Rapporteur on torture and inhuman treatment or punishment released a report at the beginning of May 2014, stating, &quot;there is a kind of endemic torture to be corrected,&quot; and that it was widespread within all Mexican law enforcement corporations. He went on to emphasize that the government &quot;is on the track to correct it&quot; (&quot;Torture is widespread within Mexican police: UN&quot;, 2014) Méndez also expressed concern about increasing militarization in some regions of Mexico, such as Michoacán.</p>

<p>Violent military and police tactics may have increased in response to increasingly aggressive cartels, or reports of such behavior could be a byproduct of the reported corruption of regional police forces (Hernandez, 2012). Regardless, this takes its toll on citizens&#39; trust in military and police forces as protectors of their freedom and security. The UNDP&#39;s 2013 Youth Expectations Index revealed that &quot;young people from Mexico, Portugal and Spain expressed the lowest levels of confidence in their institutions (police, government, politicians, justice, media, universities, social organizations and democratic institutions)&quot; (&quot;Young Latin Americans welcome future with optimism, but demand less corruption, poverty and violence | UNDP&quot;, 2013) When confidence in formal institutions is diminished, people are more likely to build their own social structures to fill the void.</p>

<h3>Vigilante Justice</h3>

<p>Communities terrorized by organized crime and distrustful of their own police forces have been backed into a corner. This has resulted in an increase in vigilantism--a measure deemed necessary to fill a void in security. The organization of <em>autodefensas</em> —vigilante &quot;self-defense&quot; militias— has increased in Guerrero as a result of greater violent conflict in the region.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, President Peña Nieto deployed thousands of federal troops and police to Michoacán to deter clashes between <em>autodefensas</em> and the Knights Templar cartel (Fausset, &quot;Mexico&#39;s Guerrero state teeters on the edge of chaos - latimes.com&quot;, 2014). In some areas, the <em>autodefensas</em> and the military unite against organized crime, but trust is a delicate issue as is the issue of power. A local leader in Guerrero warned, &quot;if a social movement arms itself, we know when they take up arms, but we don&#39;t know when they&#39;ll put them down, nor at what cost&quot; (Fausset, &quot;Mexico&#39;s Guerrero state teeters on the edge of chaos - latimes.com&quot;, 2014). Communities cautiously trust those who say they stand for their rights and security of the people, but they appear cynical about the enduring allegiance of such groups.</p>

<p>The consequences of this complex power struggle are numerous, but the most significant damage has been done to trust. Citizens caught in hot bed regions for violence can no longer trust that their neighbor is not a spy, and federal officers replace local security forces, which have succumbed to corruption (Fausset, &quot;Vigilantes hold Mexico town, tenuously, after driving out cartel - Los Angeles Times&quot;, 2014 ). This poses a significant hurdle for development efforts because it illustrates a systemic issue. Trust has been corroded so greatly that citizens do not believe in the institutions that they rely upon, the federal government suspects that some vigilante groups are actually backed by rival drug cartels (Fasset &amp; Sanchez, 2014), and <em>autodefensas</em> have been known to betray the communities that have embraced them. It is nearly impossible to imagine that development efforts could succeed under such difficult circumstances, but Mexico&#39;s history proves that its people are not the kind to surrender without a fight.</p>

<h2>Public Reactions to Violence</h2>

<h3>Government</h3>

<p>As a fairly recent member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), (&quot;Members and partners - OECD&quot;, 2014) Mexico has worked hard to get to where it is economically, and the toll of violence is not isolated to the political and social realms. That being said, the government&#39;s response to accounts of increasing violence can be seen as both politically and economically strategic. During a Conference of the Mexican Episcopate (CEM) in May 2014, President Peña Nieto shared statistics, which illustrate that crime rates have actually decreased within the country. However, instability in the states of Michoacán, Guerrero and Tamaulipas was acknowledged, and both the President and religious leaders in attendance united in their stance toward the disarmament of <em>autodefensas</em> and a return to reliance upon government authorities (Sanchez, 2014).</p>

<p>The federal government has also released their National Public Safety Program for 2014 - 2018, identifying six areas focused on the reversal of national security concerns, which increased by 93% between 2006 and 2012. These areas involve using technology to identify and track high-profile criminals after they leave prison, improving border security by adding additional police, creating regional intelligence centers that will research organized crime, creating new police academies, and increasing wages and benefits of the police (Otero, 2014). Finally, a reform was recently passed, which will allow members of the military who commit crimes against citizens to be tried in civilian courts. Prison reform, which focuses on providing necessities for proper reintegration into society, is also taking place (Jimenez &amp; Nieto, 2014). These efforts are a critical step toward addressing the public&#39;s concern and distrust of military and police corruption and have the potential to be incredibly impactful.</p>

<h3>National and Social Media</h3>

<p>Mexico has a history full of revolutionaries who have taken stances against injustice in whatever form it takes. It, then, should come as no surprise that violence within Mexico has been taken on by both national and social media. The Los Angeles Times warns that &quot;Mexico has become one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, especially those covering issues involving corruption, the drug war and political misconduct&quot; (Wilkinson, 2012) To make things worse, it&#39;s been reported by human rights organizations that authorities have rarely investigated the killings or kidnappings of journalists, likely due to corruption in regional forces. This has significantly impacted the way that news is covered in Mexico. For instance, an attack was waged on the office of El Mañana, a newpaper in Nuevo Laredo, a border town in the state of Tamaulipas. El Mañana, surrounded by powerful cartels and regular displays of violence, took the threats issued to them seriously and announced the next day that they would no longer report on &quot;violent disputes&quot; (Wilkinson, 2012) Similar cases have occurred throughout the country, leaving citizens with fewer formal ways to get information about what is going on around them.</p>

<p>In much the same way that <em>autodefensas</em> organized themselves to fill a security vacuum in their neighborhoods, individual citizens have taken to social media to fill the information vacuum left by the censorship of the media. Twitter hashtags have been created for different towns, allowing users to function as an informal sort of news service (Kirchner, 2014). Unsurprisingly, cartels have also embraced social media as a means of distributing their messages of intimidation and fear, and anonymity online is not as anonymous as one would like to believe. YouTube videos have been posted of gang executions (Kirchner, 2014), and blatant threats toward &quot;Internet snitches&quot; have been issued in gruesome forms. In Nuevo Laredo two people who posted messages on popular sites that aggregate reports of drug-related violence were murdered and put on display with a note warning of similar action against others speaking out against the cartels (Goodman, 2011).</p>

<p>Citizens using social media for the distribution of news also risk legal repercussions. For instance, two people in Veracruz found themselves in trouble for inadvertently passing a rumor along that resulted in mass panic; they were charged with terrorism and sabotage but later released (Goodman, 2011). Amnesty International summed this situation up well, saying that the drug war &quot;creates a climate of distrust in which rumors circulate on social media as people try to protect themselves, because there is no reliable information available&quot; (Goodman, 2011).</p>

<p>What&#39;s more concerning is that a recent study suggests that there is a relationship between the persistent violence in Mexico and increased desensitization. The research focused primarily on the cities of Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Veracruz and used data from Twitter to monitor the affect and expression of emotion in posts as violence increased (Georgia Institute of Technology, 2014). In the report&#39;s conclusion, the researchers stated that &quot;While violence was on the rise in our regions of interest, our findings showed a decline in negative affect as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects that are known to be psychological correlates of desensitization&quot; (De Choudhury, Monroy-Hernández, &amp; Mark, 2014). The also offered up an alternative explanation that sounds all too familiar--&quot;it is also possible that people have started to self- censor their Twitter posts out of fear of retaliation—an aspect that may manifest as desensitization&quot; (De Choudhury, Monroy-Hernández, &amp; Mark, 2014).</p>

<p>While technology implementation is often heralded as a sort of panacea for development efforts, it can have unintended consequences. Social media is a magnifier, capable of increasing the range and volume of a message&#39;s distribution and its resultant effects, whether positive or negative. Messages of fear <em>and</em> solidarity are capable of spreading, one just as quickly the other, and they are hard to contain once they have been disseminated. This adds an additional level of complexity to the challenge of development in areas of conflict.</p>

<h2>Development in Areas of Conflict</h2>

<p>A brief look at homicide rates in comparison to illiteracy and population growth rates for the states of Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Michoacán, and Guerrero suggests that, with further research, a correlation between violence and development growth could be established.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1.</strong> Comparison between state homicide, illiteracy, and population growth rates (&quot;Mexico in Numbers&quot; 2014)</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <td>State</td>
  <td>Homicides (2010)</td>
  <td>Homicide Rate per 100k (2010)</td>

  <td>Population Growth Rate (2010)</td>

  <td>Nuevo Leon</td>

  <td>2.2</td>
  <td>4653458</td>
  <td>1.9</td>

<tr>
  <td>Tamaulipas</td>
  <td>1307</td>
  <td>39.99</td>
  <td>3.61</td>
  <td>3268554</td>
  <td>1.7</td>

<tr>
  <td>Michoacan</td>
  <td>2029</td>
  <td>46.63</td>
  <td>10.18</td>
  <td>4351037</td>
  <td>0.9</td>

<tr>
  <td>Guerrero</td>
  <td>2085</td>
  <td>61.53</td>
  <td>16.68</td>
  <td>3388768</td>
  <td>0.9</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The numbers above illustrate that states with the lowest homicide rates have the lowest rates of illiteracy and more significant population growth than states with higher homicide rates. It&#39;s been reported that in areas with high levels of violence, such as Veracruz, parents are more likely to pull children from school, or schools have been shut down entirely (Wilkinson, 2011). This undoubtedly affects development in education and could impact illiteracy rates as a result.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>A culture of violence does have the potential to negatively impact development efforts. However, the resilience of the Mexican people is inspiring. When institutions fail to protect the public or disallow them from speaking out against injustice, citizens create their own informal institutions to fill the vacuum. Acemoglu and Robinson noted that &quot;the exact path of institutional development during these periods depends on which one of the opposing forces will succeed, which groups will be able to form effective coalitions, and which leaders will be able to structure events to their advantage&quot; (Acemoglu &amp; Robinson, 2012). Mexico is at a critical juncture. Generations-old extractive institutions are being challenged, and things have gotten ugly along the way, but there is still potential to overcome them. Promotion and protection of health, safety, and education are paramount to improved development in Mexico, and the current government has taken a significant amount of action toward improving transparency and extending the reach of social services to the public. Based on the historic resilience and determination of Mexico&#39;s people, I am cautiously optimistic of their future.</p>
