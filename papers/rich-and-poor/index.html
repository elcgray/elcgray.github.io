  <h1 class="page-title">Why Are Some Nations "Rich" and Others "Poor"?</h1>
  <p>Some, such as economist Jeffrey Sachs, argue that the wealth and poverty of nations is based upon their geographic location. Others believe that it&#39;s contingent upon a nation&#39;s history, with colonialism being the most commonly referenced event in the past few hundred years. For example, Martinussen highlighted Hamza Alavi&#39;s theory on colonial legacy, which asserts that foreign rule impacts the course a country will follow after it has attained its independence. In these countries&#39; cases, over-development of civil and military bureaucracies and underdevelopment of the democratic aspects are likely to result in asymmetrical and discordant paths toward progress (Martinussen, 1997, p. 183). Acemoglu and Robinson are also proponents of history&#39;s impact on a nation&#39;s success or failure. Quite pointedly, they reference colonialism&#39;s effect, stating that &quot;the extractive institutions that underpinned the poverty of these nations were imposed, or at the very least further strengthened, by the very same process that fueled European growth: European commercial and colonial expansion&quot; (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p.271). They, however, push their theory beyond the acknowledgement of historic contributions to the success or failure of nations, considering the institutional dynamics present, as well.</p>

<p>It is institutional dynamics, Acemoglu and Robinson emphasize, that determined whether or not a country took advantage of the opportunities presented in the 19th century, and &quot;the roots of the world inequality we observe today can be found in this divergence...the rich countries of today are those that embarked on the process of industrialization and technological change starting in the 19th century, and the poor ones are those that did not&quot; (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 301). They acknowledge that colonization was a crucial period for those countries affected and that the early stages were a critical juncture that would have long-term effects on their economic and political development (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 408-409), but they separate themselves from others on this topic with their detailed analysis of the link between inclusive economic and political institutions and prosperity, emphasizing that the enforcement of property rights, the creation of a level playing field and the encouragement of investment in new technology and skill sets are key to a nation&#39;s prosperity (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 429).</p>

<p>Institutional dynamics are also a focal point of the United Nations Development Programme, whose International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth states on their website that inclusive growth is the &quot;premise that societies based on equality tend to perform better in development. For instance, countries with more equal income distribution are likely to achieve higher rates of poverty reduction than very unequal countries. Inclusive growth is both an outcome and a process&quot; (&quot;International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth: What is Inclusive Growth?&quot;). Their site goes on to emphasize that equal opportunity for participation, decision-making and receipt of the benefits thereof are important components of such growth. When discussing development innovations of the IPC, they seem to align themselves with points within Acemoglu and Robinson&#39;s theory, as they acknowledge that &quot;it is also becoming evident that the structure of their [developing nations&#39;] economies also matters with regard to the potential to create jobs and undertake economic and social upgrading all of which are vital for the economic and social sustainability and resilience of their growth paths&quot; (&quot;International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth: Development Innovations&quot;).</p>

<p>Finally, if we are to accept Acemoglu and Robinson&#39;s explanation of what make nations &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;, one could go so far as to draw a comparison between a nation&#39;s technological advancement and the inclusivity of its economic and political institutions. With this comparison, it&#39;s fairly clear that use of modern technology tends to correlate with a nations&#39; wealth and, consequently, the inclusivity of its institutions. Hanson further reinforces this with the identification of four interacting influences that shape the impact of technology--the properties of that technology; political structures, institutions and policies; economic structures, institutions and market forces; and the social use and adaptation of technology as defined by the culture and characteristics of a society (Hanson, 2008, p. 7). The comparison between a country&#39;s technological distribution and the inclusivity of their economic and political institutions is not perfect. There are exceptions, such as China, but Acemoglu and Robinson would also likely assert that China&#39;s current success under extractive institutions is short-lived and will come to an end.</p>

<h2>Political Institutions&#39; Role in the Wealth or Poverty of Nations</h2>

<p>Political institutions play a key role in whether or not a nation is &quot;rich&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;. Acemoglu and Robinson express their stance on this topic, stating that, &quot;while economic institutions are critical for determining whether a country is poor or prosperous, it is politics and political institutions that determine what economic institutions a country has&quot; (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p.43). They further emphasize their point by commenting that &quot;the politics of institutions is central to our quest for understanding the reasons for the success and failure of nations&quot; (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 83). Sujay Ghosh aligns himself with this stance, as well, acknowledging that the &#39;rules of the game&#39; are set by political institutions as they establish the expectations, preferences and strategies to be employed in a nation&#39;s development. Politics are ultimately about the allocation of power, and power is exemplified in both primary political institutions - such as a nation&#39;s own government - as well as in secondary political institutions such as NGOs or activist groups (Ghosh, 2009, p.476). Political institutions that encourage and enable balanced distribution of power are more likely to embrace and adopt economic institutions that do the same thing. This virtuous circle also contributes to the likelihood of a nation&#39;s adoption of more liberal policies toward technology integration and increased access to and production of free media resources. In turn, this allows a country to establish more and greater political alliances with countries outside its borders as part of a global society, and a nation&#39;s involvement in the global network is integral to its prolonged success.</p>

<h2>The Standards for Determining Who&#39;s Rich and Who&#39;s Poor</h2>

<p>Gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity per capita, referred to as GDP (PPP) per capita, is the preferred method of measurement for economists when making a determination of wealth. This measurement considers the relative cost of living and inflation rates of each country being compared. Further, it measures GDP converted to an international dollar called the Geary-Khamis dollar so that comparisons can be made between countries and over time (&quot;The World’s Richest and Poorest Countries | Global Finance&quot;). In short, GDP is most effectively used to assess market production, but it is often inaccurately considered to be an indicator of human well-being, as well (Stiglitz, Sen, &amp; Fitoussi, 2009, p.12). Economists are quick to acknowledge that GDP isn&#39;t a perfect form of measurement, and other tools have been developed in an attempt to compensate for what it lacks in areas such as quality of life, income distribution and capability.</p>

<p>Professors Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi provide what is likely one of the most comprehensive assessments of indicators used for the measurement of wealth and poverty in their <em>Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress</em>. Right out of the gate, they acknowledge that &quot;statistical indicators are important for designing and assessing policies aiming at advancing the progress of society, as well as for assessing and influencing the functioning of economic markets. Their role has increased significantly over the last two decades. This reflects improvements in the level of education in the population, increases in the complexity of modern economies and the widespread use of information technology. In the &#39;information society&#39;, access to data, including statistical data, is much easier&quot; (Stiglitz, Sen, &amp; Fitoussi, 2009, p. 7). However, they warn that &quot;What we measure affects what we do; and if our measurements are flawed, decisions may be distorted&quot; (Stiglitz, Sen, &amp; Fitoussi, 2009, p. 7). This is the crux of the problem with the standard form of measurement employed to determine who&#39;s rich and who&#39;s poor.</p>

<p>In Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi&#39;s warning, they emphasize what we measure affects what we do. When we measure the quantities of money possessed and use it to determine the success or failure of nations, that, too is what we tend to employ as a solution to the &quot;problem&quot; of poverty. Acemoglu and Robinson point out quite adeptly that &quot;countries are poor because of their extractive institutions which result in lack of property rights, law and order, or well-functioning legal systems and the stifling dominance of national and local elites over political and economic life. The same institutional problems mean that foreign aid will be ineffective, as it will be plundered and is unlikely to be delivered where it&#39;s supposed to go&quot; (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 453). Further to this point, Peter Townsend criticizes the World Bank&#39;s rule-of-thumb measurement of $1 per day as the measure for poverty, stating that &quot;this crude indicator may have been a convenient interim measure for practical purposes, a short-term expedient, but has not turned out to be of continuing value&quot; (Ehrenpreis, 2006, p. 6). He goes on to say that &quot;income&quot; and &quot;poverty&quot; are equally problematic concepts to define. He then acknowledges that poverty has historically been related to income and is a core concern still, but other resources such as access to public services, employment and assets also need to be considered in this calculation (Ehrenpreis, 2006, p. 5).</p>

<p>David Brady also questions this method of measurement, noting that absolute measures such as GDP are severely limited in their ability to measure the complexity of highly developed countries&#39; economic structures and of poverty, especially when that standard is employed without consideration to historical and national contexts (Brady, 2003, p. 721). He goes on to emphasize the importance of social exclusion in the determination of which nations are considered &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;, noting that &quot;social exclusion means incomplete citizenship and unequal access to the status, benefits, and experiences of typical citizens in society&quot; (Brady, 2003, p. 723-724). This, quite predictably, leads Brady to express support in Sen&#39;s capability model as a more appropriate form of measurement than GDP. It&#39;s likely that Acemoglu and Robinson would align with Brady&#39;s assertion that a government&#39;s interest in social exclusion requires them to have an interest in economic inequality, as well (Brady, 2003, p. 725). Nanak Kakwani also aligns with the capabilities model, encouraging the measurement access to resources such as education, employment and health care, and encouraging a form of measurement that sets the poverty line according to the cost required to achieve basic human needs (Ehrenpreis, 2006, p.21). This is likely the most comprehensive means by which to determine the wealth or poverty of nations. However, it is also the most complex, which may explain why GDP remains the most common form of measurement to date.</p>

<p>As a result of increasing criticism for GDP as the primary method for wealth/poverty measurement, the UNDP has been working fervently to present more effective forms of measurement, such as the Human Development Index (HDI) and its complementary Human Poverty Index (HPI), which has since been replaced by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). Sakiko Fukuda-Parr discusses the implementation of these new measures, stating that,</p>

<p>Despite this shift to a multidimensional poverty concept, monitoring has continued to rely on the income measure. At the global level, the $1/day (PPP) measure developed and updated regularly by the World Bank is the one that is consistently used to monitor the size and trends in global poverty. At the national level, most governments define poverty threshold lines by household income. Measures of poverty used by researchers also rely on the income- and consumption- based national and international measures. For sure, a wide range of other indicators are used at both global and national levels. For example, the eight Millennium Development Goals have 49 indicators to monitor progress. But it is the income measure that is most used to gauge trends overall (Ehrenpreis, 2006, p. 7).</p>

<p>Caterina Ruggeri Laderchi echoes Fukuda-Parr&#39;s general assessment and concern with the trend to stick to monetary means of measurement even after the introduction of more comprehensive tools (Ehrenpreis, 2006, p. 10). She addresses the bigger problem inherent in these persistent yet inaccurate means of defining and measuring poverty by pointing out that they &quot;have important implications for targeting and policy. The considerable lack of overlaps between the different approaches means that targeting according to one type of poverty will involve serious targeting errors in relation to other types&quot; (Ehrenpreis, 2006, p. 11). This, too, aligns well with the warning initially presented by Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi in this regard.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the failure of each of these tools comes with inappropriate use of the measurements&#39; results. Stiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi rightly acknowledge that GDP is not wrong so much as it is often wrongly used (Stiglitz, Sen, &amp; Fitoussi, 2009, p. 8) and go on to point out that &quot;there appears to be an increasing gap between the information contained in aggregate GDP data and what counts for common people&#39;s well-being&quot; (Stiglitz, Sen, &amp; Fitoussi, 2009, p. 12). The danger in this lies in assumptions of success or wealth that can very quickly dissipate, as was experienced in the housing bubble of 2008 and the corresponding financial crisis. That being said, it&#39;s reasonable to say that the most effective way to measure such a complex issue requires the consideration of multiple values.</p>

<p>Acemoglu and Robinson&#39;s bold assertion that &quot;technological change is only one of the engines of prosperity, but is perhaps the most critical one (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 271)&quot; leads to the suggestion that the distribution and dissemination of data may become another effective category through which we can measure the wealth or poverty of a nation. This is, in part, thanks to their account of the impact of the Industrial Revolution:</p>

<p>The creative destruction that would be wrought by the process of industrialization would erode the leaders&#39; trading profits and take resources and labor away from their lands. The aristocracies would be economic losers from industrialization. More importantly, they would also be political losers, as the process of industrialization would undoubtedly create instability and political challenges to their monopoly of political power (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p.300).</p>

<p>Fritsch argues that &quot;it is possible to conceptualize technology as an endogenous and political factor that is deeply embedded into the global system,&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p.28) and that &quot;technological leadership and the mastering or control of large technological systems is necessary to maintain or improve a relative power position in the international system. Technology is instrumental in achieving political goals. It does not transform the basic interaction patterns between the system units or the character of the system at large&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p.39). With this in mind, it is not difficult to imagine that a tool with such &quot;inherent political qualities&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p.31) could be used to assist in the measurement of &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; nations, as well. The attached maps, Figures 1 and 2, are presented as a general illustration of the similarities between wealthy nations and public data distribution levels.</p>
