  <h2>A Tumultuous Past</h2>

<p>Mexico was at the heart of colonialism in Latin America, with Cortés&#39; conquest of the Aztecs setting the bar and pace for colonization of the region. After the fall of the Aztecs, the Spanish established that region as the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and Tenochtitlan became what is Mexico City today. From the start, indigenous communities were kept from positions of power within the government, and the primary purpose of the region and its people was clear—&quot;Mexico was required to supply raw materials to Spain, which would then produce finished goods to be sold at a profit to the colonies <a href="#mexico">(“Mexico: A Country Study,” 2014)</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>When the country established independence in 1821, it was physically and economically devastated by war, and political instability resulted, with nearly 50 regime changes over the course of the following 30 years <a href="#history">(“Mexican History - After Independence,” 2014)</a>. The Mexican Revolution of 1910 became the first social and political revolution of modern times, and the Mexican Constitution that still governs the country today was established in 1917. It was the first of its kind to include social rights protecting the poor and working classes, and it established equality of men and women.</p>

<h2>Current Development Efforts</h2>

<p>Mexico&#39;s tumultuous past likely contributes in a very significant manner to its modern-day economic and political systems. In the past thirty years, there has been a significant shift in focus, including prioritization of socio-economic programs implementing information and communication technology (ICT) into the heart of government policy, and measures such as the Human Development Index (HDI) suggest that changes made have been for the better.</p>

<p>Mexico&#39;s free market economy contains a mixture of both modern and outdated industry and agriculture <a href="#cia">(“World Factbook: Mexico,” n.d.)</a>, however increased efforts in improving the competitiveness of telecommunication, energy, and transportation suggest that recent administrations&#39; focus now prioritizes technology-centric industries as a means of improving development efforts throughout the country. For instance, the world&#39;s first comprehensive climate change law was enacted by Mexico <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 108)</a>. Additionally, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) noted,</p>

<p>As the hardware and electronics industry shifted to China and other countries in Asia, the major hardware companies with a presence in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico started transforming their manufacturing plants into ICT service centres, leveraging the available infrastructure and skilled human resources. The principal software development and ICT service centres in Latin America are now found in locations that had specialized heavily in electronics...Mexico, in addition to its software maquiladora service programmes and programmes for supporting innovation and competitiveness, launched the software industry development programme (PROSOFT) in 2002 <a href="#innovating">(“Innovating, gaining market share and fostering social inclusion success stories in SME development,” 2011, p. 68)</a>.</p>

<p>Mexico is also engaged in cooperation projects for the exchanging of researchers in areas such as agriculture, biotechnology and ICTs, which were developed at the School for Policymakers in Science, Technology and Innovation <a href="#innovating">(“Innovating, gaining market share and fostering social inclusion success stories in SME development,” 2011, p. 74)</a>.</p>

<p>Most notable (and reminiscent to priorities and sentiments of the Mexican Revolution) are Mexico&#39;s current efforts to improve social equality. The Grand Jalisco Alliance is a forum for citizen participation that connects the government with its constituents in order to meet goals established in the state&#39;s development plan. It has a focus on coordinating public policy with policies on corporate social responsibility for which a Development Portal has been created to help communities, organizations and individuals &quot;come together, share ideas and work together to reduce poverty and the digital divide <a href="#innovating">(“Innovating, gaining market share and fostering social inclusion success stories in SME development,” 2011, p. 86)</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mexican government is participating in alliances such as this while creating and maintaining their own organizations for technological advancement and transparency, such as the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), AMITI (Mexican Association of the IT Industry), and the e-Mexico initiative, which is a project focused on enabling greater access to government information and public services <a href="#kuwayama">(Kuwayama, Ueki, &amp; Tsuji, 2005, p. 124)</a>. Additionally, the Informatics Development Programme has been developed with a focus on four main areas--e-health, e-economy, e-government and e-education. The general intent is to increase access to technology--specifically the Internet--and harness it as a means of improving education and access to health and justice system information, provide better resource access to the disabled, connect different cultures and linguistic groups, and promote small and medium enterprise (SME) business growth within the country <a href="#kuwayama">(Kuwayama, Ueki, &amp; Tsuji, 2005, p. 281)</a>.</p>

<h2>Echoes of the Past</h2>

<p>It is important to acknowledge that, while Mexico&#39;s advancement efforts are noble, there is still a significant gap in income distribution <a href="#cia">(“World Factbook: Mexico,” n.d.)</a> and although monopolies of industries that were once in place have been removed in technicality, there is much more work to be done. Kuwayama, Ueki, &amp; Tsuji noted in their report that &quot;although Mexico opened its market to competition in 1996, Telmex, the former State telecom monopoly that was privatized in 1990, continues to dominate most market segments; nevertheless, increased competition has helped bring down Internet access charges and led to new price structures, especially in the face of growing competition from wireless and cable-modem services <a href="#kuwayama">(Kuwayama, Ueki, &amp; Tsuji, 2005, p. 283)</a>.&quot;</p>

<h2>Achievements in Development</h2>

<p>As previously noted, there is plenty to critique in the rollout of policies and programs related to technology in Mexico, but there is also much that can be celebrated. It is apparent that the Mexican government is focused on the implementation of ICT as a means of improving the quality of life through greater government transparency, higher education, access to healthcare, and improved job opportunities.</p>

<p>The United Nations Development Programme&#39;s (UNDP) 2013 report underscores the success of these efforts, noting that &quot;Mexico is a leader in moving rapidly towards universal health coverage by adopting an innovative financing mechanism <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 81)</a>.&quot; The Oportunidades program, originally called Progresa, started in 1997 and focuses on diminishing current and future poverty through the distribution of cash incentives that families can use to invest in the health and education of their families <a href="#oportunidades">(“Oportunidades, a Human Development Program,” n.d.)</a>. As of 2012, it was one of the largest programs of its type, impacting over 5 million households with distributions of about $3 billion <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 84)</a>. It&#39;s also been used as a model for other countries. For example, New York City&#39;s Opportunity NYC: Family Rewards program was started in 2007 and closely imitated Oportunidades&#39; structure <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 85)</a>.</p>

<p>The UNDP&#39;s latest report shows that Mexico is categorized as a high human development country with a life expectancy of 77.1 at birth, and 8.5 mean years of schooling in comparison to 13.7 years of expected schooling <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 144)</a>. Their Human Development Index (HDI) has gone from 0.598 in 1980 to 0.775 in 2012, steadily increasing year after year <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 148)</a>. Additionally, their adult literacy rate was measured at 93.1% between 2005-2010 <a href="#malik">(Malik, 2013, p. 171)</a>.</p>

<p>One can easily conclude that the conceptualization and implementation of technological solutions to Mexico&#39;s development needs have been reasonably effective. However, it should be emphasized that these efforts are but one component of an elaborate process. Economic disparity is still a significant concern, and that problem can be exacerbated by technology, further underscoring the differences between the haves and have nots within a society. The Mexican government&#39;s promotion of transparency and citizen participation will only empower its constituents if they are backed up with consistent actions. Increasing access to ICT for the improvement of health, education, and social/cultural engagement is a step in a positive direction, but the success or failure of these development efforts are heavily reliant upon the follow-through.</p>
