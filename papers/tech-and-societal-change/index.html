  <h1 class="page-title">Technology and Societal Change</h1>
  <p>When the protests in Tunisia began, few probably anticipated that it was the beginning of a dramatic shift in tone and stance for citizens of countries throughout Northern Africa and the Middle East. The Occupy movement followed shortly after the Arab Spring with people across the world uniting under the slogan of &quot;we are the 99%&quot;. Offering merit to Apter&#39;s theory of violence (Martinussen, 1997, p.179), Arab countries&#39; citizens are still uniting (and dividing) behind their causes online, via text message and in person to protest unfair representation and treatment by their governments and overthrow those responsible for it. On the other hand, Occupy protests against the distribution of wealth have been mostly non-violent and can be found in the greatest concentration in the Americas, Western Europe and Australia. Although the approach has been different, the message being sent from across the globe is quite similar. Global citizens are aware that they&#39;re not being treated fairly by the elite, and they&#39;re willing and able to fight against extractive political processes or behaviors.</p>

<p>Technology has afforded many individuals and organizations across the globe the opportunity to participate in the process of political discourse, and as a result, technology has become one of the most powerful tools that political institutions can wield in development efforts. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multinational corporations (MNCs), activist and terrorist organizations all use technology to apply pressure to the way development is done, and this force directly impacts the recipient nation-states. Nations in need of assistance must choose to adapt to pervasive modern demands or risk being disconnected from the parties (and their resources) that are already a part of the global network. These borderless and sometimes faceless organizations push forward with their demands for new political and economic processes to be established—those that they believe will ensure a nation&#39;s progress (however that is defined by the group)—and they&#39;ve proven that they are capable of changing the course and structure of a nation. This underscores these organizations first as political institutions and further establishes them in their role as primary players in the process of development.</p>

<h2>The Role and Function of Political Institutions in Development</h2>

<p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) states clearly on the main page of its website that the goals of their development program include that of building democratic societies (&quot;United Nations Development Programme&quot;). With this statement, the UNDP identifies itself as a political player, asserting that <em>democratic</em> societies are desirable and expected in order for development efforts to succeed. It&#39;s through such communications that the pressure to adapt begins to be applied to developing countries in need of assistance. From this example alone, it&#39;s quite apparent that political institutions still play a primary role and function in development, however the parties that can be defined as actors in the political landscape are changing rapidly.</p>

<p>Brown said that the state, as defined from a realist perspective, is &quot;the institution through which all other bodies operate, the institution which regulates other bodies and decides the terms under which they can act&quot; (Brown, 2001, p. 32). This concept of the nation-state&#39;s possession of total autonomy is unlikely to have ever truly existed at the time of Westphalia&#39;s inception, nor could it exist now. State-centric governance is much more complicated in a world of global networks (Fritsch, 2011, p. 37). The interdependent nature of the world only grows more complex as globalization&#39;s reach extends across the planet, making it different for nation-states to maintain sovereignty as defined in the Peace of Westphalia (Krasner, 1995, p. 115). The interconnectivity that we now have at our disposal is capable of empowering diverse interest groups and enabling the formation of broad coalitions regardless of nationality or geographic location. As was the case for the Stuarts in 1688 (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p.211), such coalitions have proven themselves to be capable of demanding change from or the removal of government structures in their entirety.</p>

<p>If primary political institutions are to be defined as those directly involved in the distribution of power (Ghosh, 2009, p.476), then coalitions such as Wikileaks (WikiLeaks, 2013), Anonymous and even Al Qaeda provide an example of the type of actors that are taking the stage today and the tools that they wield. These types of coalitions also exemplify the point Fritsch makes, that &quot;the process which nurtures and disseminates technological change involves a complex web of interactions among a range of different subjects and institutions&quot; and that these systems are rarely confined to the domestic sphere (Fritsch, 2011, p. 34). The Internet expands the playing ground for political discourse, which is capable of drawing those within and outside of a particular nation-state into the debate as to what&#39;s best for a nation and its people. This &quot;local contextualisation of global discourses&quot; (Hui, 2010, p. 175-176) creates new challenges for nation-state governments as they are charged with mediating development processes. Fritsch asserts that &quot;To cope with the effects of growing interdependence, state and non-state actors increasingly have to cooperate on the international level, which often takes place within international governmental organizations, regimes, and private non-governmental forms of cooperation-like strategic alliances between MNCs&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p. 37).</p>

<h2>Non-Governmental Organizations</h2>

<p>Martinussen noted that the study of political systems in developing countries tends to focus on the capability of those systems to address the problems of state-building, nation-building, participation and the problem of distribution and redistribution of goods and services necessary for its citizens (Martinussen, 1997, p. 171). Non-government organizations (NGOs) regularly offer their services as solutions to these problems and often end up having more political clout than the local governments do in developing countries, sometimes even undermining local efforts. They make themselves viable as primary political institutions within a nation-state by placing themselves in the position of being what Moe defines as &quot;structures of cooperation&quot; but also &quot;structures of power&quot; (Moe, 2005, p. 215). Ghosh reiterates this belief, asserting that NGOs &quot;have a political dimension in their very origin, as politics deals with the question of power in different spheres of social relations&quot; (Ghosh, 2009, p.476). Ghosh further asserts that the political institutions&#39; role in development involves setting the &#39;rules of the game&#39; (Ghosh, 2009, p.476). The path that development efforts take, as Acemoglu and Robinson point out quite clearly, depends entirely on which side succeeds, which groups are capable of forming effective coalitions and which leaders can structure events to their advantage (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p.210). Ghosh argues that NGOs find themselves in an advantageous and powerful position when brought into developing countries, as they have the opportunity to improve the quality of participation by citizens in the development process. This is done through the alteration of existing political processes that are destructive, the promotion of democracy (a primary focus of the UNDP), and the consequent reduction of marginalization of the country&#39;s citizens (Ghosh, 2009, p.482-485).</p>

<p>NGOs are not insusceptible to corruption, but the trend appears to be leaning toward these organizations nonetheless. Mayhew provides an example of the influence of NGOs, noting that &quot;as donors increasingly fund NGOs rather than governments, and pressurise governments to build &#39;partnerships&#39; with NGOs to deliver basic services and become a third partner in development, the state legislature in many countries has begun to pay more attention to this emerging phenomenon&quot; (Mayhew, 2005, p.728) She then points out that, in 2001, the OECD suggested that between 15 and 20 percent of development aid was being channeled through NGOs (Mayhew, 2005, p.743). Mayhew emphasizes quite appropriately that &quot;if NGOs are truly to be seen as development &#39;partners&#39; rather than alternatives to government, the nature of linkage and balance between NGOs and state players will be critical&quot; (Mayhew, 2005, p.749).</p>

<h2>Development and Technology</h2>

<p>Nation-states today, whether through partnerships with NGOs or at the mercy of political actors such as the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization or even terrorist organizations, find themselves at a crux between maintaining the status quo and adapting to the quickly-evolving world around them. Technology has played a role in the development of nations throughout history; the rate at which it progresses now has made it even more difficult but ever more important for nation-states to keep up. Technology in itself may not be an actor, but it is a tool utilized by the most influential of political institutions today. Fritsch posits that &quot;technological progress in information and communication technologies (ICTs) and transportation has caused intensified and more complex economic, social, and cultural interactions and structures, which resulted in a partial decoupling from physical surroundings like state territory and borders&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p. 37). In order to mediate the processes of development, nation-state leaders must choose to utilize these technological resources or risk being disconnected from the &quot;network.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritsch argued, &quot;Technology is instrumental in achieving political goals&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p. 39). History has proven that opposition to technological advancement rarely works in favor of the government figures standing in its way. Acemoglu and Robinson gave the Ottoman Empire&#39;s resistance to the implementation of the printing press as an example of this; their lag in development behind Western Europe is seen as proof of the negative impact of their aversion to technological advancement (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 215). The motives behind such behavior, of course, are typically hinged on maintaining the power held by the government at the current time. Friedrich von Gentz was quoted as saying, &quot;We do not desire at all that the great masses shall become well off and independent…How could we otherwise rule over them (Acemoglu, &amp; Robinson, 2012, p. 225)?&quot; This, too, underscores the challenge and charge of the nation-state in mediating development processes, as this process may require the relinquishment of existing power for the well-being of the country&#39;s populace.</p>

<p>Castells commented that &quot;the global economy does not embrace all economic processes in the planet, it does not include all territories, and it does not include all people in its workings, although it does affect directly or indirectly the livelihood of all humankind&quot; (Castells, 2000, p. 134). Based off of this statement, it&#39;s reasonable to say that the role and function of political institutions in a developing nation-state is to create a political and economic environment that is inclusive and interactive, providing the means for its people to grow and to effectively interact with and contribute to the world. If the nation-state&#39;s focus is on the growth of individuals through the provision of basic needs such as security, health, stability, education and freedom, the sights are essentially set on eliminating what Myrdal called &quot;societal stagnation&quot; (Martinussen, 1997, p. 80). Once humans are safe, healthy, stable, educated and free, they&#39;re much more capable to participate in and contribute to the global human network we live within today. Again, Fritsch contributes to this stance, arguing that &quot;The global diffusion of technology certainly has intensified and extensified the economic, social, political, and cultural interdependence between all system actors. The increase in political conflicts concerning technology-specific questions of design, distribution, and regulation is just another symptom for techno-globalism and its central role for prosperity, security, identity, and the reproduction of a global human society&quot; (Fritsch, 2011, p. 41). Hanson further reinforces this stance, emphasizing that &quot;the technologies that transmit knowledge, wealth and values across national boundaries have enormous implications for three central concerns of the study of international relations: (1) diplomacy, war and peace; (2) the structure of the global economy and the distribution of the world&#39;s wealth; and (3) national sovereignty, identity and culture&quot; (Hanson, 2008, p. 3). Acemoglu and Robinson would likely agree with the assertion that technology is a vehicle for societal change and that those most actively in opposition to it typically are so because of personal investments that do not benefit from such change.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>At its most basic level, politics is about establishing a means of governance over people. Acemoglu spent a significant amount of time focusing on the negative impact of extractive institutions on the development of a nation. Thanks to technological advancements, citizens of the world today are much more interconnected and consequently are much more aware of those who rule by extractive means such as oppression. They are more capable of taking effective action against these entities, challenging and even shifting the distribution of power as a result. This changes the way that political players interact and where those players come from, but it does not diminish the political institution&#39;s role in the process of development, which is to determine the rules and regulations that are established for providing goods and services to a nation&#39;s people and ensuring their security and prosperity.</p>
