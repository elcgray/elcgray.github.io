  <p><em>The Roles of Social Media in Conflict</em>
<br /></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Information warfare is not new. It has always held the power to incite or to assuage conflict. A well-timed release of scathing photos or information about an opponent could be enough to turn an election in a candidate&#39;s favor. A prime time speech announcing that another country possesses biological warfare could help gain the necessary support of a country to engage in war. Media channels played a role prior to the advent of social media, and they still do, but there is no doubt that social media has significantly altered the ways in which we interact with each other today.</p>

<p>As is the case with most tools, social media can also be used for noble purposes, but it can also be used to spread a message of fear, of power, and control. Governments, drug cartels, and terrorist groups can use these channels and the information flowing through them with as much aptitude as their opposition. Messages can be traced back to their source. Channels can be flooded with information so that the sheer volume of content drowns out the desired message. Organizations can glean information about dissenters from social media channels and use it to verbally—and sometimes physically—threaten and harm them. The blessing and curse of social media can be seen in its ability to empower all.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>It was during Vietnam that United States citizens saw the first televised footage of war. Those images deeply disturbed the American public by bringing that war into their homes. This affected the public&#39;s response to and support of the war in Vietnam significantly. In Rwanda, rhetoric of hate encouraging Hutus to &quot;send Tutsis back to Ethiopia via the rivers&quot; was spread across the country by radio in the 1990s. Those words were followed by action and resulted in a genocide that claimed nearly a million lives in a matter of a few months.</p>

<p>Radio and television are still incredibly powerful mediums, but the news media circle is now adjoined by a variety of social media platforms—Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, for example—and what they bring to the table is different than that of their more formal counterparts. Most notably, it can deliver information to an audience in real-time. Censorship of social media, though still feasible, is increasingly difficult. When one video gets taken down, you need only to search by keywords to locate another copy that hasn&#39;t yet been removed. Here are a few examples of social media&#39;s role in conflict.</p>

<h3>Government Surveillance</h3>

<p>It&#39;s long been known that the US uses surveillance information to anticipate threats to national security. A recent article detailed the Pentagon&#39;s use of social science data to develop tools that can be used to &quot;model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world&quot; (Ahmed, 2014). The Department of Defense launched the Minerva Research Initiative in 2008 in order to better understand the socio-political, cultural, and behavioral aspects of &quot;strategically significant&quot; areas of the world. The 2011 Egyptian revolution, 2013 Gazi park protests, and more are being used to try to identify the kinds of people who are involved in a &quot;social contagion&quot; and when that shift occurs. This is part of an effort to determine the tipping point of such events (Ahmed, 2014). The author of the article expresses concern about the way in which data—including that gathered from social media resources—was being used to identify threats to national security, noting that &quot;Minerva is a prime example of the deeply narrow-minded and self-defeating nature of military ideology. Worse still, the unwillingness of DoD officials to answer the most basic questions is symptomatic of a simple fact – in their unswerving mission to defend an increasingly unpopular global system serving the interests of a tiny minority, security agencies have no qualms about painting the rest of us as potential terrorists&quot; (Ahmed, 2014).</p>

<h3>Conflict Deterrent</h3>

<p>Social scientists and police are using social media to combat gang violence in Chicago, which has struggled to reduce its homicide rate, regardless of trends downward in other large cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Recent studies found that people in high-crime, high-risk neighborhoods had a 900% greater likelihood to be victims of homicide if they participated in a social network (Moser, 2013). The Chicago Police Department (CPD) is now using social media tools to map relationships between the city&#39;s most active gang members in an attempt to defuse potential &quot;hot spots&quot; situations that could result in homicides; this use of network analysis and &quot;focused deterrence&quot; helped police identify connections between individuals and figure out who was at risk. Initial results of this change of approach seem to indicate that it&#39;s been effective, though a long-term determination on the impact of social-networking policing is still necessary (Buntin, 2013).</p>

<h3>Conflict Catalyst</h3>

<p>A 14-year old girl was shot and killed by her friend after a Facebook fight escalated (&quot;Endia Martin&#39;s Death Exposes Entrenched Chicago Violence « CBS Chicago,&quot; 2014). Individual acts of violence that started out as online spats and quickly evolved into physical altercations are not uncommon. Social media has proven itself to be a tool capable of escalating or augmenting conflict rapidly. It has also become an invaluable tool of revolutionary movements, allowing individuals to unite in solidarity for a cause, regardless of their geographic location. Momentum can grow exponentially, and once a critical mass has been gained, it is difficult for the opposition of such a movement to stop it. The Egyptian government felt the power of such a movement when they tried to stop rioters by shutting down access to the Internet in 2011 (Ackerman, 2011); this only drew more people out into the streets in protest and greater attention from major news outlets worldwide. President Mubarak and his government were removed from power shortly thereafter.</p>

<h2>Relevance</h2>

<p>Opinions on the significance of social media&#39;s role in conflict run the gamut. Ems emphasizes that political protests of today have arisen from &quot;the complexity of intertwined social and technological&quot; realms. New media communications tools are presented as resources that can be used to augment, expose, motivate, and democratize a global, socio-technical audience (Ems, 2014). Fuchs offers a more critical view of the role of social media in conflict. He investigates claims from mass media that social media played an integral role in the 2011 UK riots and the Arab Spring, arguing instead that it distracts from the true issues at hand (Fuchs, 2012). He suggests that we must first analyze the societal structures that frame and condition actions, including the use of technology. The base of his article focuses on the role of societal structure, its stratification, and social deprivation in the UK and Egypt as the preliminary factors of the riots and uprisings. His conclusion asserts that &quot;what happens in a crisis is never just or fair, but an expression of the structural violence built into the system (Fuchs, 2012)&quot;. Murthy, in considering the role of social media tool, Twitter, in society, posited that &quot;the power of the medium is that profound tweets also appear side by side with banal ones – second by second, minute by minute, and hour by hour&quot; (Murthy, 2011). He cautioned that there are limits to the tool&#39;s reach, as its audience is strongly socioeconomically stratified (Murthy, 2011).</p>

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

<p>Cammaerts&#39; assessment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in society found that its everyday uses have increased exponentially. However, he warns that we need to remain critical of unfounded claims about the ways in which social media can revolutionize the economic, cultural, and political aspects of society. He emphasizes that the changes that have taken place with social media seemingly at the helm are part of a more complex, historical process (Cammaerts, 2005). Cammaerts concludes that there are plausible optimistic and pessimistic views of ICT use in social movements and democracy. He acknowledges that the Internet is an essential component of many transnational organizations, but he also emphasizes that the offline aspects of those organizations are important factors. &quot;Each time we find a pattern that points to conflicting findings. Discontinuity and agency in some practices, and at the same time (structural) continuities in others (Cammaerts, 2005)&quot;.</p>

<p>Chouliaraki focuses on the manifestations of solidarity movements via social media and asserts that &quot;the disposition of &#39;I have a voice&#39; is an ambivalent one, in that it can both catalyse change and reproduce power relations between West and global South (Chouliaraki, 2013)&quot;. She describes the dimensions of this process, starting with re-mediation—the presence of a community&#39;s voice in major news networks. Then comes the inter-mediation of social media, where the voices on global topics of concern are organized. After that, trans-mediation occurs, where the voice moves from a symbolic to a physical realm of action. She concludes that &quot;insofar as convergent journalism remains embedded in structures of iterability that reproduce the dominant visions and divisions of community, cosmopolitan solidarity will remain, at best, a rare moment of revolutionary resonance between the West and its others, or, at worst, a narcissistic reverberation of our own pity for these others&#39; suffering (Chouliaraki, 2013)&quot;.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The power of media to provoke or abate conflict is historically significant. Social media follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, but the speed at which it can gain momentum makes it an especially sharp double-edged sword. Social media most definitely plays a vital role in conflict, but it is just one component in an incredibly complex social system. Those that wield social media as a weapon in conflict must be careful not to injure themselves or those they care about in the process. We all have an increasingly serious responsibility to pay attention to our governments, our peers, and our own uses of social media in conflict. We should strive to make conscious decisions on how to use social media tools to communicate, organize, and improve our deeply interconnected societal systems.</p>
