<h1 id="into-republika-srpska">Into Republika Srpska</h1>
<p>Bosnia has two autonomous entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Republika Srpska (RS). Sarajevo is within the Federation of BiH, and Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska. There are no border crossings between these regions, so the best way to tell which you’re in is by looking at the road signs; the Federation of BiH uses the Latin alphabet, and Republika Srpska uses Cyrillic. Republika Srpska is predominantly Serb, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is mostly Bosniak to the north, Croat to the south.</p>

<p>On September 25th, the tour group consisted of Rachel and me, so our guide drove us two-and-a-half hours northeast to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_Genocide_Memorial">Srebrenica Genocide Memorial</a>. We passed from the Federation region into Republika Srpska without ceremony.</p>

<p>The fog was heavy as we wound through the mountains of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinaric_Alps">Dinaric Alps</a>. The forests were thick and felt very old. I have never seen terrain like what we drove through that day. There weren’t many places to stop and take photos, and I didn’t feel right taking any in the car while talking with our guide. He was substituting for his brother who was unable to make it at the last moment. He seemed tense, so we talked about 90s hip hop and the movies he watched to teach himself English.</p>

<p>We turned off onto a smaller country road and wound through farm land. The fog was thick until late in the morning. Conversation about US pop culture naturally turned to questions about our current presidential election, and our guide posited that the area we were driving through was one that would likely vote for Trump. He then pointed at a flock of sheep and said they would vote for him, too, and baahed “Truuuuump!” We didn’t get much deeper into the conversation than that. It was enough.</p>

<h2 id="referendum-day">Referendum day</h2>
<p>A while later, our guide apologized for driving slowly and explained that that day was referendum day in Republika Srpska and he wanted to be careful. A contentious vote was being held to determine whether the region would declare its own national day (separate from the rest of the country) on the date of its founding in 1992. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s constitutional court had declared the referendum unconstitutional for discriminating against Bosniaks and Croatians, but the region proceeded with the referendum anyway.</p>

<p>Our guide was a Bosniak and noted that the police are predominantly Serb, so he didn’t want to risk getting pulled over. He pointed out the Serbian flags hanging from homes and on fences as we continued driving. It reminded me of the Confederate flags I grew up seeing hung on porches and in the backs of trucks, and it made me feel a similar kind of discomfort. I understand why he didn’t want to attract unnecessary attention.</p>

<p>The referendum was an act of defiance against the unified state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Republika Srpska’s president, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milorad_Dodik">Milorad Dodik</a> is a huge proponent of <a href="https://iwpr.net/global-voices/nationalist-talk-ahead-bosnian-local-polls">seceding from Bosnia-Herzegovina</a> and has promised to hold a referendum to decide on that in 2018. Most believe it’s unlikely to occur since Republika Srpska, though backed by Russia, lacks broader international support. If they were to succeed, it would effectively destroy the peace accords established in Dayton.</p>

<h1 id="srebrenica">Srebrenica</h1>
<p>The Srebrenica Genocide Memorial, or Srebrenica-Potočari Memorial and Cemetery for the Victims of the 1995 Genocide officially, is tucked between the mountains in a broad valley about 10km outside of the city of Srebrenica itself. The museum was closed on the day we were there due to the referendum, so we walked around the cemetery in relative quiet. There were many places where visitors could sit alone and reflect or gather together and pray.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="/images/srebrenica/srebrenica-pano.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<figcaption>50,000 people; 300 UN soldiers to protect against 5,000 militia; over 8,000 men and boys killed</figcaption>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Rachel and our guide were both using the restroom when I saw cars with Serbian flags driving by and honking their horns, likely in celebration of the referendum.</p>

      </a>
    
  
  
</figure>

<p>As we looked over the wall of names of those buried, our guide noted that the date of death indicated on the tombstones reflects the year that person’s death was actually confirmed; people whose death years were more recent didn’t necessarily die then. That’s just when their remains were identified.</p>

<p>It’s been over 20 years since the massacre. They’re still digging and finding bodies.</p>

<p>It was especially difficult to see birth years that were the same as our own and imagine being in any one of their positions at 13 or 14 years old. I cannot imagine how it could have felt to learn that a man known as the Butcher of Bosnia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratko_Mladi%C4%87">Ratko Mladić</a>, and the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) had promised to return Srebrenica to the Serbs and <a href="http://www.srebrenica360.com/#/panorama?id=p9">“take revenge upon the Turks in this region.”</a> Nor can I imagine how it must have felt to be part of the 25,000 refugees gathered at Potočari awaiting evacuation in July 1995 when Mladić and his army began their attack and United Nations forces <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/world/un-details-its-failure-to-stop-95-bosnia-massacre.html">repeatedly failed to provide protection</a>.</p>

<p>Thinking about it for too long makes it hard to believe in the goodwill of others, particularly as we come up on the most divisive US election cycle I’ve personally experienced. Humankind repeats itself regularly enough for me to see obvious behavioral patterns between the Bosnian War and what’s happening in the US and parts of Europe today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Social, ethnic, and racial tensions exacerbated by the rhetoric of demagogues</li>
  <li>Violent language resulting in violent actions</li>
  <li>Families and friends turning against each other based on differences like race, ethnicity, and religion</li>
  <li>The defining of “us” as human and “them” as less-than-human and thus undeserving of respect, protection, and even life</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s very important for us to pay attention to the mistakes of our collective past and work together to avoid repeating them.</p>

<p class="notice">This election is really, really important, but especially for Bosnian Americans because we have seen what hate speech can do in a country. Some of the older ones are scared, because this is a similar thing going on back in Bosnia in the 1990s before the election.
<br /><br /><em>Ibro Tucakovic in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/04/bosnian-muslim-vote-missouri-republican-donald-trump">“How Missouri’s ‘Bosnian vote​’ could cost Donald Trump – and turn the state blue”</a></em></p>

<h1 id="return-trip">Return Trip</h1>
<p>We ate lunch in Srebrenica then headed back toward Sarajevo and talked about lighter things. We learned that our guide dislikes vegetables, but especially hates buranija (string beans). A roadside stand was advertising buranija, and our guide didn’t know the English word for the vegetable, so he described them: very common at holiday functions, their parts can be separated and used in different types of dishes, and “you eat them and then you throw it back up.”</p>

<p>When talking about Bosnian politics, our guide quoted his favorite rapper to explain the process: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNTBb1u6UGg">“it’s all about the benjamins.”</a> It seems our political systems aren’t so different after all!</p>

<p>Our guide to Srebrenica is 30, so he was about 10 when he and his family returned to Sarajevo through Tunel Spasa for his father. He lived through war, as his parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents all had. While acknowledging historic tensions between ethnic groups, he joked that, because his wife was half Croatian, half-Serb and he was Bosniak, they got to celebrate three times as many holidays. He also pointed out his home as we walked back into the old city in Sarajevo and took us to the candy shop with the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_delight">lokum</a> so he could buy some for us before we parted ways.</p>

<p>We had a lot of time to talk, and it was apparent that many of the things he has lived through were difficult to discuss, but he shared a part of himself with Rachel and me that day nonetheless. There is no more effective way to learn from and empathize with others than through the sharing of stories and time. My view of the world has been impacted by that which he shared with us. I hope that we contributed something new and positive to his worldview, as well.</p>
