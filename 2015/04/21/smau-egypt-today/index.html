<h2>2015</h2>

<p>In January, violent protests continued as Egypt&#39;s four year anniversary of the overthrow of the Mubarak regime passed. Continued conflicts with terrorist groups in the Sinai have led the government to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/world/middleeast/egypt-moves-to-eradicate-town-near-gaza-strip.html">raze the city of Rafah</a> and create a buffer zone along the border shared with the Gaza Strip. In February, Egypt retaliated to ISIL&#39;s execution of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by bombing their positions in eastern Libya.</p>

<p>Parliamentary elections were set to be held in March but were then <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/egyptian-court-suspends-parliamentary-elections-150303130411282.html">suspended</a>. They&#39;re now expected to be held in May or June.</p>

<h3><em>Ongoing issues</em></h3>

<p>All of the <a href="/2015/03/29/smau-background-egypt#triggers">problems</a> attributed to the start of Egypt&#39;s revolution—corruption, economic disparity, and repression—have <a href="/2015/04/14/smau-sm-today-egypt#freedom-house">remained the same or become more severe</a> over the past four years. The most significant increase, however, can be seen in the government&#39;s use of military and police force.</p>

<h4>Repression</h4>

<p>In 2014, presidents Mansour and Sisi put over 140 laws into effect that criminalized new behaviors and increased punishments for existing offenses. Egypt&#39;s war against terrorism has further justified the government&#39;s establishment of more draconian laws.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the military takeover of 2013, a public discourse has evolved churning out incessant accounts in which enemies of the Egyptian state and its people, external and internal, known and unknown, human and otherwise, are constantly conspiring to plot against the country and target its security as well as the health of its national economy. Against a rich tapestry of intrigue and terrorist discourse, the security apparatus has emerged, in this narrative, as the only national saviour capable of protecting the country from complete chaos. In fact, the legitimacy of the Sisi regime continues to derive largely from his promise to rid the country of terrorists and to restore security and order. In this regard, he makes grateful use of actual violent attacks against military and other targets especially in Sinai <a href="#abdelrahman">(Abdelrahman, 2015)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In March of 2014, Alaa Abdel Fattah, founder of the <a href="/2015/04/14/smau-sm-today-egypt#trials">No Military Trials for Civilians</a> movement, was accused of assaulting a police officer and stealing his communication device during a demonstration. Other officers corroborated this testimony against Fattah, though questions have been raised about the legitimacy of this information, due to conflicting statements. Fattah and another political protestor were jailed pending trial, which is permissible under Egypt&#39;s emergency law: &quot;When the prosecution and judiciary know that the case file isn&#39;t powerful enough to guarantee a jail sentence, they keep the defendant in jail pending the trial, which they decide how long is going to take&quot; <a href="#sabry">(Sabry, 2014)</a>. Fattah was sentenced to five years in jail in February of 2015.</p>

<p>On April 11th, U.S. citizen Mohamed Soltan was <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/04/11/398992763/egyptian-court-sentences-u-s-citizen-to-life-in-prison">sentenced to life in prison</a> for alleged ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, and over a dozen others were sentenced to death for their involvement in protests against Morsi&#39;s ouster. Morsi himself was sentenced to 20 years in prison <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/egypts-ex-president-mohamed-morsi-jailed-protest-deaths-muslim-brotherhood">today</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. lifted its military supply ban on Egypt at the end of March. As a result, Sisi&#39;s military will be armed with F-16s, missiles, and tanks. Annual military funding of $1.3 billion has also been reinstated <a href="#calamur">(Calamur, 2015)</a>.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>Dr. Maha Abdelrahman, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, spoke of the broader implications of what&#39;s happening in Egypt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An inflated police force is not unique to Egypt. With the rise of neoliberal capitalism and its strategies of ‘accumulation by dispossession’, many regimes, including those in the ‘democratic’ west, have increased investment in policing and surveillance, especially targeting particular localities and populations; namely the poor, the unemployed, migrants and blacks. Different policies such as the infamous ‘stop and search’, the <a href="http://ipna.co.uk/">‘Injunctions for the Prevention of Nuisance and Annoyance’</a> in the UK and the <a href="http://www.police.wa.gov.au/Yoursafety/Antisocialbehaviour/tabid/1076/Default.aspx">‘Prohibited Behaviour Order’</a> in the State of Western Australia have created a ‘culture of reporting’ and often given increasing discretionary powers to the police <a href="#abdelrahman">(Abdelrahman, 2015)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Summary of scary shit: Heavily militarized police presence in Ferguson. Protests banned. Journalists threatened. News helicopters barred.</p>&mdash; Radley Balko (@radleybalko) <a href="https://twitter.com/radleybalko/status/499282827738120192">August 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><small>Radley Balko is an American journalist who writes for the Washington Post and published <em>Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces</em> in 2014. </small></p>

<p>Riots last year in Ferguson, Missouri were met by a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/police-militarization-ferguson-2014-8">militarized police force</a>. The Wall Street Journal noted that &quot;billions of dollars of excess military equipment and funding to buy other gear has flown to local police departments over the past two decades&quot; <a href="#grossman">(Grossman, 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>Attention to cases of police brutality, especially toward minority groups, has increased in the past year. Yesterday, the New York Times released an article, &quot;1.5 Million Black Men,&quot; which found that &quot;Ferguson has 60 men for every 100 black women in the age group,&quot; and that &quot;incarceration and early deaths are the overwhelming drivers of the gap&quot; <a href="#wolfers">(Wolfers, Leonhardt, &amp; Quealy, 2015)</a>.</p>

<p>Alaa Abdel Fattah&#39;s father spoke at a news conference after his son was first imprisoned: &quot;Is your generation going to pass on to my grandchildren, your children, a better society than that we passed on to you? I hope so; I hope you succeed in what we failed to accomplish. And again, I am sorry. We couldn&#39;t accomplish for you what we had hoped&quot; <a href="#sabry">(Sabry, 2014)</a>. The United States and Egypt differ in many distinct ways, but state and federal governments&#39; actions implicate support for the tactics being used toward citizens in Egypt. We too should sincerely ask ourselves if we&#39;re passing a better society on to future generations.</p>
