  <p>The Arab uprising&#39;s accomplishments throughout the MENA region are often attributed to the use of social media. In comparison, social media was recognized as one of several common components in analysts&#39; assessments of Tunisia.</p>

<h3>Youth</h3>

<p>Youth initiated the uprisings when they circulated a video of <a href="/2015/03/26/smau-background-tunisia/">Bouazizi</a> setting himself on fire. The calls to action online were reinforced and expanded in the streets by civil and political organizations. Though no one could have predicted what would trigger the outrage of the nation, protests were described by analysts as intentional, organized events. Tunisian cyber activists had established connections with international activist groups like Anonymous to combat censorship in the years prior to the 2010 revolution <a href="#honwana">(Honwana, 2013, p. 50)</a>.</p>

<br />
<small>Hamada Ben­-Amor, or <em>el général</em>, helped mobilize many Tunisian youth against the regime.
</small>
</center></p>

<h3>Technology proliferation</h3>

<p><center>
<small>
<em>&quot;Three months before Mohammed Bouazizi burned himself in Sidi Bouzid we had a similar case in Monastir. But no one knew about it because it was not filmed. What made a difference this time is that the images of Bouazizi were put on Facebook and everybody saw it&quot; <a href="#beaumont">(Beaumont, 2011)</a></em>
</small>
</center></p>

<p>Access to the Internet in Tunisia was very high for the region—in 2009, the number of Tunisians using the Internet was around 2.8 million out of 5.4 million citizens. Of the 2.8 million online, 2.5 million of users had Facebook accounts, and 42% of them were between ages 18-24 <a href="#honwana">(Honwana, 2013, pp. 58-59)</a>.</p>

<p>Tunisian bloggers and cyber activists were important actors in the uprising, functioning as mediators between the people and official media, which was done at great risk to their safety <a href="#sarnelli">(Sarnelli, 2013, p. 159)</a>. As blogs and other social media were censored with greater frequency, Facebook (which was not blocked) became the primary resource for dissidents. Twitter was valuable, but only to a very small subset of the population; there were about 200 active users on Twitter prior to the Tunisian uprisings and a few thousand once it got started <a href="#beaumont">(Beaumont, 2011)</a>.</p>

<p>A common opinion is that social media changed the methods through which citizens could fight for democracy. In defense of this stance, Howard asserted that &quot;the countries with the lowest levels of technology proliferation have also tended to have the weakest democratization movements&quot; and went on to emphasize that &quot;digital media has allowed people to unite around shared grievances and build local responses to them. They were not inspired by Facebook; they were inspired by the real tragedies <em>documented</em> on Facebook&quot; <a href="#howard">(Howard &amp; Hussain, 2011, pp. 47-48)</a>.</p>

<h4>Al Jazeera</h4>

<p>Al Jazeera was the first major news organization on the scene, and their decision to air the Tunisian protests is believed to have played a critical role in the uprising&#39;s success. Wadah Khanfar, head of Al Jazeera, spoke of the media company&#39;s role in the movement just months after it occurred: &quot;Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it]. We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world—and internationally, globally, through our English channel&quot; <a href="#khanfar">(“A historic moment in the Arab world,” 2011)</a>.</p>

<p>The most significant of Al Jazeera English&#39;s contributions was that it connected the English-speaking international community to Tunisian protestors, promoting interrelationships between established and new media channels. Additionally, the language used to describe events gave the movement validity as it shifted from a &quot;protest&quot; to &quot;political unrest&quot; or &quot;uprising&quot; and then to &quot;revolution&quot; on January 19th <a href="#sarnelli">(Sarnelli, 2013, pp. 164-172)</a>.</p>

<h4>Culture</h4>

<p><center>
<small>
<em>&quot;The founders of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube did not create their products with the intent of starting revolutions and ousting dictators, and though they may feel they have played a role in the process by providing these vehicles for change, these revolutions begin in the minds and imaginations of those driving them. They choose their tools and their mediums for communication, whether it is print, radio, blogging or just word of mouth, but the strength of a movement lies ultimately in the will for activism&quot; <a href="#storck">(Storck, 2011)</a>.</em>
</small>
</center></p>

<p>A number of analysts criticized the fact that many Western commentators were preoccupied with the wrong details of the revolution. They emphasized that communication technologies should not be blindly equated with democracy—how technology is used depends on who is using it and what their intentions are. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the entire media environment and culture that the technology is a part of <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1282)</a>. For example, Graziano notes that the Tunisian diaspora &quot;acted as the main driving force that shaped Tunisian activism on the Web&quot; by inspiring the dissidence of Tunisians still living in the country with their accounts of life out from under Ben Ali&#39;s rule <a href="#graziano">(Graziano, 2012, p. 541)</a>.</p>

<h3>Why this matters</h3>

<p>In the same way that some educators refuse to regard Wikipedia as a valid source of academic information, mass media and its audience have long regarded bloggers and social media users as anything but journalists. That&#39;s a complex argument to get into here, but I think this much can be acknowledged: Al Jazeera English bridged the gap between different media platforms and formats with their reporting in Tunisia. Doing so consequently gave those citizen journalists who had only ever published information via social media some credibility for their work. This has inspired new waves of citizen journalists, which will—for better and for worse—contribute a bit more color to the broad palette of our collective existence.</p>

<p>The same can be said about the naiveté, the passion, and the power of our youth. They are versatile, they are bold, and they are more aware than we often give them credit for. This isn&#39;t means for concern as long as we&#39;re not <a href="https://medium.com/message/ferguson-is-also-a-net-neutrality-issue-6d2f3db51eb0">oppressing them</a>.</p>

<h3>Next up</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll look at different analyses of social media&#39;s role in the uprisings in Egypt. See <a href="/projects/arab-uprisings/summary">here</a> for more details.</p>
