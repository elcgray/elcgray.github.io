  <p>Many analysts have spoken confidently about the positive role that social media played in the Egyptian revolution of 2011, but potentially negative aspects of the relationship were addressed, as well. We&#39;ll cover several common points in this post.</p>

<h3>Blogs</h3>

<p>Egypt&#39;s policies for online content were considerably less restrictive than Tunisia&#39;s. Prior to the protests in early 2011, Egypt didn&#39;t formally censor websites or content. Instead, Mubarak&#39;s security forces monitored communications and then harassed and imprisoned activists—a different approach to censorship than that employed by Ben Ali&#39;s regime. Despite this, a lively community of users and political bloggers blossomed starting around 2005. This allowed Egyptians to increase political awareness, communicate with other activists, and freely spread ideas of hope and change <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, pp. 1277-1282)</a>.</p>

<h3>Social networking</h3>

<p><center>
<small>
<em>&quot;Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, &#39;Wow, I&#39;m not alone. There are a lot of people who are frustrated&#39;&quot; <a href="#ghonim">(Ghonim, 2011)</a>.</em>
</small>
</center></p>

<p>About 17% of Egypt&#39;s population were connected to the Internet at home; even more connected in Internet cafes. Facebook was the most popular social networking site, with almost 5 million users—approximately 22% of all Facebook users in the region <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1277)</a>. Its role in the mobilization of protestors for the <a href="/2015/03/29/smau-background-egypt#april6">riots on April 6, 2008</a> signaled a shift toward social networking rather than blogging <a href="#sarnelli">(Sarnelli, 2013, p. 160)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="twitter"></a>Facebook and Twitter were used to announce the details of demonstrations and spread images of the regime&#39;s corruption as well as its abuse of Egyptians. Twitter was identified as a crucial enough resource for protestors that Mubarak&#39;s regime ordered mobile service providers to send out notifications like those sent by Twitter to rally his own supporters <a href="#beaumont">(Beaumont, 2011)</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook pages like <em>We are all Khaled Said</em> and the <em>April 6 Youth Movement</em> were increasingly used as resources for seeking and sharing knowledge among activists, both inside and out of Egypt. Within 6 weeks of the start of protests on January 25th, 357,000 followers on the <em>We are all Khaled Said</em> Facebook page had grown to 1,026,000. Srinivasan asserted that this is what social media did best: it interconnected the local and the global; it helped protesters think and communicate <em>across</em> rather than simply <em>within</em> networks <a href="#srinivasan">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>Rinke and Röder note, however, that &quot;the spillover from the virtual spaces to the Egyptian streets would not have been possible without other communication technologies, such as mobile phones, e-mail, and satellite television channels&quot; <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1278)</a>. At 72%, Egyptians&#39; access to mobile phones was over four times greater than their access to the Internet <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1278)</a>. Text messages and emails were used to pass sensitive information along within trusted, personal networks rather than via broad online networks like Facebook.</p>

<p>When Mubarak&#39;s regime shut down Internet and mobile phone networks, Egyptians found other ways to get their message out. For instance, an American student with friends in Egypt created a Twitter account called <em>Jan25voices</em>, which he used to publish messages his friends relayed to him by phone <a href="#sarnelli">(Sarnelli, 2013, p. 166)</a>.</p>

<h3>Al Jazeera</h3>

<p>Televisions were said to be in every living room, coffee shop, store, and waiting room in Egypt. This afforded media outlets a distinct opportunity in the Egyptian revolutions. Contradictions between the state-run channels&#39; coverage of protests and that of transnational stations such as Al Jazeera were laid bare.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera played a similar role in Egypt to that in Tunisia, positioning itself as a facilitator of two-way communication between protestors and the international public <a href="#sarnelli">(Sarnelli, 2013, p. 171)</a>. Its broadcast of the protests started the day after the January 25th demonstrations, at which point it provided live broadcasting of the uprisings until Mubarak left office.</p>

<p>The network established connections between countries in the region via its Arabic channels and outside of the region in English. Rinke and Röder emphasize the significance of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arabs do not have to overcome a language barrier to a transnational public sphere, which likely was a significant factor leading to the popular spread of protest across country borders to Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, to name just the most visible examples...transnational news channels in the Arab region can be an important relay station for disseminating the idea of anti-authoritarian protest und renewing the idea of pan-Arabism in the struggle for freedom <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1280)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newer and older media converged when Al Jazeera reporters started collecting ideas for stories from Twitter. &quot;This creates possibilities of things to move across cultural groups and make bridges between people across different segments of a population&quot; <a href="#srinivasan">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>

<p>Rinke and Röder point out that oral communication was a critical component of the uprisings. One-to-one communication promoted the trust necessary to mobilize a greater number of people <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1275)</a>. This was best exemplified in its use during Friday Mosque, where citizens congregated after prayers to discuss political issues. On <a href="/2015/03/29/smau-background-egypt#jan28">Friday, January 28th</a>, Internet and mobile phone networks had been shut down. Egyptians gathered after prayers to protest the regime, calling it a <em>Day of Anger</em>.</p>

<p>Egypt&#39;s revolution drew generations of different socio-economic backgrounds and ideologies together. Wael Ghonim spoke to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who would [have] imagined before the 25th, if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them, and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them—this is amazing. All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media, are proven wrong. This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman, how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream <a href="#ghonim">(Ghonim, 2011)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Double-edged sword</h3>

<p><a name="monitor"></a>Social media has been presented as a potent weapon against authoritarian regimes, but Morozov warned that it has also been effectively used by governments to monitor and suppress citizens. For instance, in Egypt, it was discovered that Mubarak&#39;s regime had been testing a tool developed by a Western company that allowed them to eavesdrop on Skype conversations, which were thought to be immune from wiretapping. This, Morozov said, isn&#39;t uncommon. The Egyptian government also used Internet traffic surveillance tools sold by Narus, a company owned by Boeing <a href="#morozov2011">(Morozov, 2011)</a>. &quot;Left uncontrolled, Western surveillance tools could undermine the Internet freedom agenda in the same way arms exports undermine Western-led peace initiatives&quot; <a href="#morozov">(Morozov, 2011)</a>.</p>

<p>Rinke and Röder added that, rather than shutting down online forums, the Egyptian regime&#39;s supporters interfered with discussions by spreading rumors meant to increase confusion and anxiety; text messages were sent to Egyptian mobile phones when the networks were disabled for public use, warning of pillagings and encouraging recipients to stay home and protect their families and property <a href="#rinke">(Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, pp. 1281-1282)</a>. Srinivasan also warned of the danger of echo chambers—if you surround yourself with only those who share the same ideas as yourself, you risk the likelihood of distorting your perception of reality <a href="#srinivasan">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>Fukuyama&#39;s critique of social media&#39;s role in Egypt questioned next steps in institution building:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook, which went public last week, has been credited with helping to build democracy internationally. It is true that it and other social media have democratized access to information, and have made collaboration easier. These media have also helped promote short-term mobilization of crowds and demonstrators. But networking is not organization-building. For that, we need a different and more durable platform <a href="#fukuyama">(Fukuyama, 2012)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Why this matters</h3>

<p>Srinivasan&#39;s warning that social media can create echo chambers and distort our perception of reality is one most can likely relate to. In Egypt, Twitter users were generally more well off, stayed toward the back of the crowd during protests, and tweeted about freedom while those with lower incomes protested the price of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/12/139570720/twitter-created-echo-chamber-during-egyptian-protests">food</a>. Neither stance is invalid, but to present only one side as the cause of the revolution would be false.</p>

<p>Echo chambers are a legitimate threat, perpetuated by the speed at which messages spread via social media. For example, regardless of your stance on Indiana and Arkansas&#39; recently passed Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, you&#39;ll most likely concede that echo chambers exist and have distorted the reality of the situation on the ground. <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/01/rfra-boycotts-bans-growing-backlash/70810178/">Withholding all business</a> from a state hurts the state <em>and</em> its inhabitants, including those within the LGBT community that live and work there. Lumping all of the LGBT community into one <a href="https://twitter.com/bryanjfischer/status/582952288253247488">indistinguishable mass</a> strips individuals of their humanity, rationalizing and justifying unequal treatment. The end result is that subsets of the same species are driven further and further apart; interactions and communications become harder to maintain. I&#39;ve written about how effective it was for dictators to maintain power by promoting <a href="/2015/03/26/smau-background-tunisia#divide-and-conquer">divisions</a> among their citizens. Why should we think that divisions don&#39;t weaken us as a nation?</p>
