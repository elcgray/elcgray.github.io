Libya has struggled to achieve peace and stability. After Gaddafi's death, the country broke into factions based on tribes, regions, and even cities. In July of 2012, Libya's first parliamentary elections were held and the National Transitional Congress (NTC) handed power over to the General National Congress (GNC). Sectarian attacks continued, and an Islamist militant attack on the American consulate in Benghazi in September 2012 resulted in the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other people. In October 2012, the Libyan Prime Minister was ousted. His successor was removed by March 2013 and replaced by the current Prime Minister, Abdullah al-Thani.
</p>

<p>
In June 2014, elections were held to fill the Council of Deputies—the organization that was to replace the GNC—but when secularists and liberals did well, Islamist lawmakers rejected the results of the elections and refused to recognize the Council of Deputies. Islamists and their supporters established a New General National Congress in Tripoli, and those elected to the Council of Deputies fled to Tobruk. The country has been in a state of civil war since then, which has left room for militant groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to take advantage of uncontrolled areas.
</p>

<p>
Social media use has steadily increased in Libya as it has in Tunisia and Egypt. We'll look at statistics from the Arab Social Media Report, the UN, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Freedom House in order to assess its role in Libya today.
</p>

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>
Libya has the lowest rate of Facebook use of the three countries studied for this project. For Libyans ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Facebook on February 16, 2011 was at 4.21%. In May 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 13.5%, or 878,400 people <a href="#asmr">(“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p><center>
<iframe width="400" height="325" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://www.google.com/publicdata/embed?ds=z2kg90qa3mgc2e_&amp;ctype=c&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_y=facebookpenetration&amp;fdim_y=age_group:13%26above&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;idim=country:TN:LY:EG&amp;ifdim=country&amp;tunit=D&amp;pit=1367384400000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg"></iframe>
</center></p>

<p>
In 2013, Facebook was the most visited site in Libya. It has served as a source of news for Libyans. Many city and government officials used it to share updates and communications with their constituents. Citizens used it for political campaigns like the “No Extension of GNC” movement, which protested the GNC retaining power after its transitional deadline had passed.
</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>

<p>
Libya has the lowest rate of Twitter use of the three countries studied for this project. For Libyans ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Twitter on September 1, 2011 was at 0.07% <a href="#asmr">(“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015)</a>. In March 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 0.22%; by March of 2014, the rate of use was at 0.67%, or 44,100 people <a href="#asmr14">(“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014)</a>.
</p>

<iframe width="400" height="325" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="https://www.google.com/publicdata/embed?ds=inka2ndrsatap_&amp;ctype=c&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_y=TwitterPenetration&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;idim=country:TN:EG:LY&amp;ifdim=country&amp;tunit=D&amp;pit=1362117600000&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg"></iframe>
</center></p>

<p>
Like Facebook, Twitter has also been used in political and civic campaigns. Recently, Tunisians bombarded US ambassador Deborah Jones with criticism after she tweeted about unconfirmed deaths in an air strike:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Terrible news today from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tarhouna?src=hash">#Tarhouna</a> where 8 innocent displaced <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tawergha?src=hash">#Tawergha</a> killed in air strikes. This violence serves no one&#39;s interests.</p>&mdash; Safira Deborah (@SafiraDeborah) <a href="https://twitter.com/SafiraDeborah/status/579974376776429568">March 23, 2015</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><small>Jones shut down her Twitter account due to the onslaught resulting from this post <a href="#stephen">(Stephen, 2015)</a>.</small>
<br /></p>

<h2>Internet and Mobile Access Rates</h2>

<p>
Libya's rates of Internet access are the lowest of the three countries in this project. The damage of war can be attributed to much of the country's struggle to provide and maintain information and communications technology (ICT) since 2011. Multiple Internet blackouts have occurred due to vandalism and technical failures. The Facebook page “I hate Libyan Telecom and Technology,” was created to protest Libya's unreliable telecommunications services. It gained over 20,000 followers <a href="#freedom-libya">(“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Common points of access to the Internet include homes, workplaces, mobile phones, and hotel lobbies. Cybercafés were severely damaged during the war but are reportedly beginning to make a comeback. The majority of Internet users gain access through wireless WiMax service. Broadband subscriptions are very low, at a rate of just over 1 subscription per 100 residents <a href="#freedom-libya">(“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015)</a>. Two-way satellite Internet technology has also been used by both foreign and Libyan organizations such as Al Jazeera and <a href="/2015/04/10/smau-analyses-libya#journalists">Libya Alhurra</a>.

<br />
<br />
<p>
Libya's mobile phone ratio is the highest of the three countries reviewed for this project. Their heavy use for posting messages, photos, and videos during the 2011 uprisings illustrates their ubiquity. The price of mobile phone subscriptions in Libya dropped when competition was allowed into the country in 2003, which made the technology more accessible to Libyans. Freedom House notes that "smartphones and 3G connectivity have been available since 2006, though the prohibitive cost of compatible handsets impedes their wider dissemination" <a href="#freedom-libya">(“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Internet Freedom</h2>
<p>
The categories that Freedom House uses to determine how free a country's access to the Internet is were defined in <a href="/2015/04/12/smau-sm-today-tunisia#freedom-house">Sunday's post</a>. The scores from these three categories are added to get a <b>Freedom on the Net Total</b>, which determines the status level of the country's Internet freedom—from <i>Free</i>, like Canada, to <i>Not Free</i>, like China. Libya's 2014 rating places it solidly in the <i>Partly Free</i> status.

<p>
When it comes to social media, what's most striking in Libya is the lack of government censorship. Common tools such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are accessible. Freedom House even noted that "the 'Innocence of Muslims' film that sparked protests outside the American consulate in Benghazi was not blocked by Libyan authorities, although it was made inaccessible by YouTube’s parent company, Google" <a href="#freedom-libya">(“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The greatest threat to free speech in Libya is the threat of violence by militant groups. Activists and journalists receive online threats and have been actively targeted for assassination <a href="#freedom-libya">(“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015)</a>.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Utterly devastated &amp; heartbroken...cried myself to sleep Yday..Lost all hope in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Libya?src=hash">#Libya</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIP?src=hash">#RIP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TBensaud">@TBensaud</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sami_Elkawafi">@sami_Elkawafi</a> <a href="http://t.co/N0U948l8aV">pic.twitter.com/N0U948l8aV</a></p>&mdash; Ahmed Sanalla (@ASanalla) <a href="https://twitter.com/ASanalla/status/513293903488090112">September 20, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p><small>Youth activist and blogger Tawfik Bensaud was assassinated on September 19, 2014 <a href="#masi">(Masi, 2014)</a>.</small>
<br />
<p>
Many Libyans self-censor their posts online because of threats of violent retaliation and a long history of oppression under Gaddafi, but a growing number of activists and political bloggers have also emerged despite the risks.
</p></p>

<p>
Social media has also been used to combat social issues, like students being unable to attend school due to the violence surrounding them. Haifa El-Zahawi used social media and Skype to spread the word about her project, <a href="http://www.benghazischool.com/">The Benghazi School</a>, which offered classes to students through an online portal. Students and teachers hold live classes when they can, but sessions are also recorded and posted online for asynchronous access due to unreliable Internet connectivity. El-Zahawi expressed hope that improved access to education will help deter the radicalization of youth toward groups such as ISIL <a href="#pri">(International, 2015)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>
The collapse of Gaddafi's regime resulted in a socio-political vacuum, which many different groups are now fighting to assume control over <a href="#el-kasm">(El Kasm, 2011)</a>. Acemoglu and Robinson spoke at great lengths about the struggle to break out of a vicious cycle of extractive institutions—systems that enrich the lives of a few at the expense of many. In their book, they seem to directly address the MENA region's–but particularly Libya's–current struggle, saying:
<blockquote>
A free media and new communication technologies can help only at the margins, by providing information and coordinating the demands and actions of those vying for more inclusive institutions. Their help will translate into meaningful change only when a broad segment of society mobilizes and organizes in order to effect political change, and does so not for sectarian reasons or to take control of extractive institutions, but to transform extractive institutions into more inclusive ones <a href="#acemoglu">(Acemoglu &amp; Robinson, 2013, p. 462)</a>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Zahra Langhi spoke of Libya's failures in its revolution, acknowledging that Libyans needed "national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division," and then prescribed "we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy" <a href="#langhi">(Langhi, 2012)</a>. Olivos and PaPaioannou reviewed the trends of discussions on three Libyan Facebook pages over the course of three months in 2012 and identified these themes in discussions: Human Rights, Local Themes of Interest within the Libyan Society, the Role of Digital Technologies and Social Mobilization <a href="#olivos">(PaPaioannou &amp; Olivos, 2013, p. 105)</a>. This could be interpreted as promising if the researchers' findings are indicative of a broader shift toward a structure that promotes political inclusion, compassion, and mercy.
