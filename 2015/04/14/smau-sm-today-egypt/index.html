Since Mubarak's removal, Egyptians have struggled to find a leader supportive of their initial cause. Mohamed Morsi was elected in June of 2012 and was removed by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in July 2013. Adly Mahmoud Mansour served as interim president until elections in May of 2014 announced that el-Sisi had won the presidency with 96% of votes. Protests and violence accompanied the political turmoil.
</p>

<p>
Despite—or as a result of—the tumultuous state of the country over the past four years, social media use has steadily increased. We'll look at statistics from the Arab Social Media Report on social media use in the region as well as data from the UN, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Freedom House in order to assess the state of social media in Egypt today.
</p>

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>
Egypt has the second highest rate of use (per capita) of the three countries studied for this project. For Egyptians ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Facebook on January 25, 2011 was at 5.9% <a href="#asmr">(“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015)</a>. In May 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 16.2%; by May of 2014, the rate of use was at 22.4%, or 19.4 million people <a href="#asmr14">(“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014)</a>.
</p>

</center>
<br /></p>

<p>
At the end of 2013, Facebook was the most visited website in Egypt. As the mainstream media reverted back to a self-censored, pro-military stance, citizens more heavily relied upon the site to organize and disseminate their messages. In retaliation, pro-government groups have employed tactics such as reporting pages for violations of Facebook's terms of service in order to have them shut down. Employers have been used to apply pressure to employees who are vocal on social media, and arrests for associations with anti-regime Facebook pages have taken place on repeated occasions. Some organizations, such as the <a href="/2015/03/29/smau-background-egypt#april6">April 6th Movement</a>, have even been banned <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p> <a name="trials"></a>
In spite of efforts to discourage them, many civil and activist organizations have successfully utilized social media for their causes. <i>Kefaya</i>, or "The Egyptian Movement for Change" and <i>Shayfenkom</i>, or "We Can See You," are examples of online campaigns for political movements, and the "No Military Trials for Civilians" page was used to encourage participation in street protests against unjust treatment by the government. Women's rights campaigns have also had success in raising awareness for their causes through campaign sites such as HarassMap and NooNeswa <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Twitter</h2>

<p>
Egypt has the highest rate of Twitter use of the three countries studied for this project. For Egyptians ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Twitter on September 1, 2011 was at 0.15% <a href="#asmr">(“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015)</a>. In March 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 0.61%; by March of 2014, the rate of use was at 1.26%, or 1.09 million people <a href="#asmr14">(“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014)</a>. Egypt's use of Twitter has contributed significantly to the fact that Arabic is the fastest growing language on the platform <a href="#hamdan">(Hamdan, 2013)</a>.

</center></p>

<p>
When el-Sisi issued an ultimatum to Morsi in 2013, Morsi posted his rejection of it on Twitter.
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3?src=hash">#الرئيس</a> محمد مرسي يؤكد تمسكه بالشرعية الدستورية ويرفض أي محاولة للخروج عليها ويدعوالقوات المسلحة سحب إنذارها ويرفض أي إملاءات داخليةأوخارجية</p>&mdash; د.محمد مرسي (@MuhammadMorsi) <a href="https://twitter.com/MuhammadMorsi/status/352164641352327168">July 2, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><small>Translation: President Mohamed Morsi asserts his grasp on constitutional legitimacy and rejects any attempt to deviate from it, and calls on the armed forces to withdraw their warning and refuses to be dictated to internally or externally <a href="#fitzpatrick">(Fitzpatrick, 2013)</a>.</small>
<br></p>

<p>
Then, when el-Sisi announced that he would run for the presidency in 2014, opponents and supporters alike took to Twitter to voice their opinions. A blogger explained that Twitter was "the only arena where [Sisi critics] can express their opposition" <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Internet and Mobile Access Rates</h2>

<p>
Like Tunisia, Egypt's rates of access to the Internet and mobile phones have steadily increased over the past several years. This has occurred despite a weak telecommunications infrastructure in rural and impoverished areas of the country.
</p>

<p>
Internet access is less expensive than in some of Egypt's neighboring countries, but costs are still prohibitively high because a state-owned provider holds the majority of resources. Some areas of the country are not connected to the landline grid, so they cannot access broadband services at all. Many access the internet at cafés, but Egyptians are required to provide their "names, email addresses, and mobile numbers to receive a personal identification number (PIN) to access the internet" <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Because of these infrastructural, political, and economic barriers, the Egyptian government does not need to actively censor Internet transmissions. Also, as learned with the <a href="/2015/03/29/smau-background-egypt#shutdown">Internet shutdown</a> on January 27, 2011 and other blackouts which occurred after that event, "the Egyptian government has centralized internet infrastructure and fiber-optic cables into highly controllable 'chokepoints'" <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.

Mobile phones have grown to exceed a 1:1 ratio. Phone applications like Viber, WhatsApp, Blackberry Messenger, and other Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) are popular means of communication, though the government explicitly prohibits placing international calls from mobile 3G networks. In June 2014, a leaked document revealed the Egyptian Ministry of Interior planned to buy technology to "conduct real-time monitoring of social media and communication apps such Facebook, Twitter, Viber, and WhatsApp" <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Internet Freedom</h2> <a name="freedom-house"></a>
<p>
The categories that Freedom House uses to determine how free a country's access to the Internet is were defined in <a href="/2015/04/12/smau-sm-today-tunisia#freedom-house">Sunday's post</a>. The scores from these three categories are added to get a <b>Freedom on the Net Total</b>, which determines the status level of the country's Internet freedom—from <i>Free</i>, like Canada, to <i>Not Free</i>, like China. With a score of 60, Egypt is right on the cusp of being categorized as <i>Not Free</i>, the category for countries scoring between 61 and 100 on Freedom House's scale.

In contrast to Tunisia, obstacles to access and violations of user rights have increased since the Arab uprisings in 2011. Limits on content have gone down, but self-censorship has increased. Freedom House explains that this is because the "country’s highly divisive political environment has resulted in increasing verbal harassment between social media users and a declining willingness to speak out on contentious issues, resulting in self-censorship" <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Civilians have been subjected to military trials based on comments or media they have posted online, and seven year sentences have been issued for protesting in the streets. Violence and torture of citizens and journalists is still prevalent. In March of 2014, journalist Mayada Ashraf was killed by a sniper while covering a protest. However, Freedom House still reports that "Egyptians remain adept at utilizing social media as an instrument for positive change" <a href="#freedom-egypt">(“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>Egypt&#39;s story seemed the most promising and is now one of the most sobering situations in the MENA region since the Arab uprisings first began in 2011.</p>

<p>It tells a story of battles won over the influence of Egypt&#39;s mainstream media:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Egyptians recognise that ‘older media’, such as television and radio, though accessed by most, tend to be biased. Still State TV, run by the ruling military, remains most popular, and domestic corporate media channels are self-serving and volatile in their coverage. Yet activists have explained to me that they can influence some of these media from the ‘outside in’ by documenting videos of protests, creating credible blogs, and tweeting stories to influence both international and domestic journalists. I saw these strategies in action in July, 2012 at a recent 23000+ person sit-in in Mahalla, the birthplace of Egypt’s labour movement. While this protest was sparsely reported on by the mainstream media, I observed how activists were using video cameras, blogs, and Facebook/Twitter connections to force this coverage from the outside-in <a href="#srinivasan-egypt">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It illustrates how social media technologies can and will be used by both sides of a struggle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We were the kings of social media, and now our enemies are catching up with us.” With these words, Ahmed Maher, 2011 revolutionary hero and co-founder of the April 6th Youth Movement, explained to me that today’s battle for political power has two-fronts <a href="#srinivasan-egypt">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, like it or not, this technology—or something derivative of it—is here to stay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 70+ year old military generals’ use of Facebook to release announcement, to the Muslim Brotherhood’s use of hackers, leaders from the entire range of Egypt’s political factions are striving for the upper hand in this fight <a href="#srinivasan-egypt">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most importantly, however, is the message that &quot;We will watch, listen, and if we do not like what we see - we will rise again&quot; <a href="#srinivasan-egypt">(Srinivasan, 2012)</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll look at the role of social media in Libya today. See <a href="/projects/arab-uprisings/summary">here</a> for more details.</p>
