  <p>Libya&#39;s uprisings began shortly after Mubarak was overthrown in Egypt. Like Mubarak, Gaddafi shut down Internet and mobile phone networks inside of Libya early on in the conflicts, signaling that he, like Mubarak, was aware of the dangerous potential those resources had if used against him. Analysts considered this approach and offered several common observations about social media&#39;s role in Libya.</p>

<h2>Double-edged sword</h2>

<p>Morozov provided examples of ways in which media technology could be used against citizens in <a href="/2015/04/07/smau-analyses-egypt#monitor">Egypt</a>. He also noted that Gaddafi&#39;s vast spying apparatus was known to monitor text messages, emails, and online chats <a href="#morozov">(Morozov, 2011)</a>. His regime sent text messages to threaten citizens and warn of the consequences of using social media to encourage protests. And, as was done in <a href="/2015/04/07/smau-analyses-egypt#twitter">Egypt</a>, the Gaddafi regime sent out Twitter-like text notifications in an attempt to rally supporters <a href="#beaumont">(Beaumont, 2011)</a>. Activists using Facebook to demand Gaddafi&#39;s resignation were arrested <a href="#olivos">(PaPaioannou &amp; Olivos, 2013, p. 100)</a>.</p>

<p>Media technology also created problems for those attempting to help Libyans. Humanitarian efforts like the Libya Crisis Map found that an overload of information via social media actually made it difficult for them to manage and verify the information they required to deploy aid to areas that were in need <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 9)</a>.</p>

<h2>Social media</h2>

<p><small>
<center>
<em>&quot;Internet conviviality creates unity and has democratising power that can be shared beyond what in the real world would be the traditional barriers of social and economic standing, cultural similarities and national and regional boundaries. But the Libya example has highlighted an even greater observation: that Internet conviviality can be experienced beyond Internet connectedness&quot; <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, pp. 10-11)</a>.</em>
</center>
</small></p>

<p>Leading up to the uprisings of 2011, only 14% of Libyans had access to the Internet. Gaddafi started shutting down Libya&#39;s Internet services on February 18th; they were almost entirely disabled from the beginning of March until the end of the revolution. However, protest movements increased in size and momentum despite Internet and phone network shutdowns. Those who had access to the Internet used it to spread news about conflicts. Those who didn&#39;t would collect video and photos on their mobile phones, and some would then exchange their SIM cards with people at the country&#39;s borders who could upload data on their behalf.</p>

<p>International media outlets, members of the Libyan Diaspora, and Libyans within the country all joined together to call for a &quot;Day of Rage&quot; against the regime on Februry 17th, but protests began in Benghazi two days prior to that, and the video footage collected during those events was used to increase awareness and improve the movement&#39;s credibility <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 4)</a>.</p>

<p>Twitter became a useful, low bandwidth tool inside of the country for sharing news with the outside world in short bursts. Medical needs, contact information, and satellite frequencies were also shared through such channels. One of the largest social media presences during the uprisings was the Libyan Youth Movement (LYM), which was comprised mostly of members of the Libyan diaspora. They used their large following on Twitter to disseminate messages on behalf of Libyans inside of the country.</p>

<h2>Diaspora</h2>

<p>The Libyan diaspora&#39;s role in the Libyan revolution was regarded as highly significant. The Libyan Youth Movement as well as families and friends abroad facilitated communications between Libya and the international community, especially after the Internet and mobile networks were shut down <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 5)</a>. Satellite communications, landlines, Skype, and mobile phones were used to pass messages along. These were often encoded in order to avoid detection by Gaddafi&#39;s surveillance teams. Morris noted that &quot;What was unexpected was how these connections would feed back directly to those within Libya, that the activist reports coming from within Libya but censored in Libya could be reported outside of Libya and beamed back in to generate more activism. A complete circle&quot; <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 10)</a>.</p>

<p>The dedication of diaspora members and citizen journalists inside of Libya played a role that Morris believed could not be overstated <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 10)</a>. She argued that, contrary to Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s assertion that social media campaigns lacked structure and hierarchical strength, the complex network of communications developed between entities within and outside of Libya illustrated that a rigid, persistent campaign <em>could</em> be established <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 10)</a>.</p>

<h2>Journalists</h2>

<p>Information coming out of Libya was limited by Gaddafi&#39;s restriction of the Internet and monitoring of phone lines, but social media was still used to report from within, and then mainstream media augmented those messages effectively enough to get international attention and intervention. Morris suggested that the reason why so many Libyans participated in protests was, at least in part, due to what they had seen on satellite television about the uprisings in neighboring countries. Satellite stations like Al Jazeera shared videos and posts culled from social media in their news feeds, which further connected Libyans even if they had no access to the Internet <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 6)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="journalists"></a>When Gaddafi blocked all outsiders from entering the country, citizen journalists stepped in to ensure that the Libyan uprisings were reported. They did this at great personal risk, putting themselves in between three warring groups: Gaddafi&#39;s army, freedom fighters, and allied foreign troops <a href="#stream">(“Libya’s New Citizen Journalists,” 2011)</a>. Alternative and independent media outlets such as <a href="http://original.livestream.com/libya17feb">Libya Alhurra</a> developed in Benghazi and transmitted footage of conflict via satellite Internet connections <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, pp. 4-5)</a>.</p>

<small><em>Mohammed Nabbous, founder of Libya Alhurra, is one of the most well known citizen journalists in Libya&#39;s revolution. He was killed by snipers on March 19, 2011.</em>
</small>
</center></p>

<p>Morris spoke of the potential impact of such citizen-driven efforts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evidence coming from citizen journalists of state inflicted violence does not necessarily lead to international support in the form of military intervention. The unprecedented use of R2P [Responsibility to Protect] in the case of Libya may more closely reflect the international communities sentiments towards the Gaddafi regime itself than any direct empathy with the Libyan people. It is novel nonetheless that the international community found justification for action within the citizen journalist reports coming from Libya; new media reporting of the crisis therefore may have been the final invitation to act <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 8)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When eastern Libya was liberated by rebel fighters, international press and mainstream media organizations took over the role that citizen journalists had filled in their absence. Social media continued to be relied upon as a source of information by media channels <a href="#morris">(Morris, 2014, p. 7)</a>.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>The speed at which information can be spread is likely to be the greatest strength and weakness of social media. It disseminated information about what was happening inside of Libya across the globe at a rate that Gaddafi, despite all of his sophisticated efforts, could not stop. The rate at which information was disseminated also complicated humanitarian efforts on the ground in Libya, making it more difficult for aid workers to determine where they most needed to deploy their resources.</p>

<p>Also of note is the fact that a nearly continuous deficit of reliable access to Internet and mobile networks did not result in an end to the Libyan movement. Protestors still found ways to get messages out of the country, and once that information was out, it was spread by a broad network of allies as well as members of the Libyan diaspora. Social networks—both on and offline—played important roles in Libya&#39;s revolution.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll look at the role of social media in Tunisia today. See <a href="/projects/arab-uprisings/summary">here</a> for more details.</p>
