        Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Conclusion
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>In his book, <em>Writing on the wall: Social media, the first 2,000 years</em>, Standage is quick to point out that &quot;social media does not merely connect us to each other today—it also links us to the past&quot; <a href="#standage">(Standage, 2013, p. 89)</a>. Protestors have used media devices to disseminate messages of solidarity and of dissent for generations.</p>

<p>In the Arab uprisings, the ability with which citizens united and coordinated their message was undoubtedly facilitated by social media, but the experience gained from organized movements of the past was imperative to their efficacy. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this project are that:</p>

<p><strong>Social media did not cause the Arab uprisings.</strong> Underlying grievances of corruption, repression, economic disparity, and censorship triggered them. Social media empowered citizens to find their voice as a people (<em>sha&#39;b</em>). It enabled them to organize and to expose injustice. It spread their messages <em>quickly</em>. And most importantly, it garnered a broad audience.</p>

<p><strong>Social media played a significant role in the Arab uprisings.</strong> It enabled a &quot;synchronization of opinion&quot; <a href="#standage">(Standage, 2013, p. 1044)</a> across the MENA region as dissatisfied individuals identified common offenses made by their governments and established a unified demand for dignity and freedom from oppression. Solidarity was key. Politics of dominance and exclusion don&#39;t work, as can be seen most clearly in Libya today.</p>

<p><strong>Social media is more than a tool.</strong> It&#39;s a platform for cultural and political expression which can be used to augment the voices of a movement. Corrupt institutions fear the discovery of this voice, which can be seen in the history of censorship and repression in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.</p>

<p>The facilitation of communication and political expression was critical to the Arab uprisings. It offered citizens of repressive countries a window to the outside and allowed them to learn from people who had experience holding peaceful political protests or solicit help from those who were connected to large audiences.</p>

<p><strong>Social media is not a panacea.</strong> The ease and speed with which a message can be disseminated is social media&#39;s source of power and its greatest weakness. Ordinary individuals can speak for themselves rather than relying upon media conglomerates to do it for them, but these benefits don&#39;t come without consequences:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Morozov notes, the Internet “penetrates and reshapes all walks of political life, not just the ones conducive to democratization.” Anyone who hopes that the Internet will spread Western-style liberal democracy must bear in mind that the same digital tools have also been embraced by campaigners with very different aims, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and ultra-right-wing nationalist groups in Russia <a href="#standage">(Standage, 2013, p. 4097)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Social media moves so quickly that it sets up an <em>expectation</em> of equally fast results. As can be seen in Egypt and Libya, rapid changes can&#39;t necessarily be equated with permanent ones. Tunisians are learning that changing the infrastructure of a country takes a lot of time and effort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While active citizenship and civil participation among young Tunisians is critical to sustaining the country’s positive socio-economic momentum and achieving political stability, very few engage in any form of political participation, except mobilizing for demonstrations. In fact, youth activism is done in an ad-hoc manner with social media as the mobilizing tool, outside the formally established civil and political institutions <a href="#wb-tunisia">(“World Bank Report: Young People in Tunisia Still Frustrated by Social and Economic Obstacles,” 2014)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can be discouraging, but inaction isn&#39;t an effective alternative. The consequences of inaction impact more than just those in the MENA region—refugees are flocking to European Union countries&#39; shores to escape violence and poverty.</p>

<p><strong>Social media adds complexity.</strong> As more and more voices enter the arena, it can be difficult to identify a single message. Greater freedom of expression is extended without bias, so &quot;bad ideas will proliferate as well as good ones,&quot; <a href="#standage">(Standage, 2013, p. 4119)</a> but this also means that divergent messages can be debated out in the open and acknowledged rather than ignored.</p>

<p>The complexity of this system can also cause us to be distracted by events rather than the root of an issue. &quot;We live in an exaggerated present—we pay too much attention to recent experience and too little attention to the past, focusing on current events rather than long term behavior&quot; <a href="#meadows">(Meadows &amp; Wright, 2008, p. 1934)</a>. This is why it was important to look at the history of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya when trying to understand social media&#39;s role in the Arab uprisings.</p>

<p><strong>Social media isn&#39;t going away.</strong> System dynamics scientist Donella Meadows said that &quot;self-organization is such a basic property of living systems that even the most overbearing power structure can never fully kill it, although in the name of law and order, self-organization can be suppressed for long, barren, cruel, boring periods&quot; <a href="#meadows">(Meadows &amp; Wright, 2008, p. 1402)</a>. The social media of today—Twitter, Facebook, and the like—are the latest iteration of self-organization in humanity, but they are not likely to be the last. As we learn, diversify, and increase in complexity, new communication and organizational systems will develop.</p>

<h2>Why this all matters</h2>

<p>This was a difficult subject to get people to engage with me on, but that reinforces a fundamental point of the project: <strong>social media doesn&#39;t motivate change in and of itself. We are motivated by the things we <em>feel</em>.</strong></p>

<p>I have been reading a lot about the protests against police brutality toward people of color. As I write, protests are taking place because of the suspicious death of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-mysterious-death-of-freddie-gray/391119/">Freddie Gray</a> after being arrested by Baltimore police. This morning, I came across this music video produced for Run the Jewels&#39; song, Close Your Eyes (<strong>warning</strong>: strong language is used):</p>

<p><center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkGwI7nGehA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center></p>

<p>As the video played out, tears began—and would not stop—streaming down my face. Even now as I think about it, I am emotionally affected by the message of the video. You can read the full director&#39;s statement on <a href="http://www.runthejewels.net/">Run the Jewels&#39; site</a>, but here&#39;s what stood out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me, it was important to write a story that didn’t paint a simplistic portrait of the characters of the Cop and Kid. They&#39;re not stereotypes. They&#39;re people - complex, real people and, as such, the power had to shift between them at certain points throughout the story...I believe that it is important that the way we feel when we see these events in real life has an effect on us. That we resonate with what we know to be right and we don&#39;t numb ourselves out so those feelings can simply be swept away, we must confront them and take some action, however small, or we’ll be stuck in the same cycle of violence and hate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The goal of this project is not to provide answers to the cause of the Arab uprisings as much as it is to open up a dialogue about the many faces and forms of injustice; social media is a platform which can be used to make others aware of injustices and unite against them.</p>

<p>Thinking differently about the struggle for dignity and identifying it as a human right is the first step toward taking action to combat injustice. You don&#39;t have to go to another country to make a difference in this. That struggle for dignity is happening in the US, as well, and the world is watching:</p>

<p></center></p>

<p>Another critical step in combatting injustice is speaking out against it. Maryam Al Khawaja spoke clearly on the consequences of silence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The governments will continue to try and silence people. In Syria, Yemen, Egypt, and Bahrain, they will continue to torture, detain, use excessive force, and kill, as long as the people and political leaders of this world choose to stay silent. They will continue to kill their citizens until Western governments realize that their real interest lies in countries with real democracies, not authoritarian regimes. Until they realize that the best way to create stability is by including people and treating them like citizens, not by silencing them and tying their hands to provide a fake calm in the country <a href="#al-khawaja">(Al Khawaja, 2012, p. 780)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actions we do or do not take against inequality communicate much more about our values than mere words do. Don&#39;t be silent, and be sure to back up what you say matters with actions.</p>
