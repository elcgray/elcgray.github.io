        <h2 id="what-triggered-the-movements-in-libya">What triggered the movements in Libya?</h2>
<p>The background of Libya’s uprising is both simpler and more difficult to cover. It’s simple in that its history as an independent nation is fairly short—the country was established in 1952 after Italian colonialism and World War II ended. It had only had two rulers—King Idris and Colonel Mu’ammar Gaddafi. It’s more difficult to cover because information on life within Libya’s borders in the 40-some years prior to the uprising in 2011 is more sparse and suspect of being tightly controlled the regime.</p>

<p>Libya suffered greatly under Italy’s colonial rule and during World War II when it was the site of large land warfare campaigns between Axis and Ally troops. The region at that time consisted of three independent territories, which were eventually consolidated and led first by King Idris. King Idris was overthrown by the Free Unionist Officers on September 1, 1969. Gaddafi took power as chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council on January 16, 1970.</p>

<p><a name="triggers"></a></p>

<h3 id="volatility"><em>Volatility</em></h3>
<p>Gaddafi’s rule consisted of unpredictable extremes. Libyans experienced internal and external power struggles in the 1970s and were outcasts in the 1980s due to ties to acts of terrorism such as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. International perceptions of the country improved in the 1990s. Through it all, “Gaddafi was always plotting…he was always one to cultivate allies. If, and/or when, they chose against him, he quickly dispensed with them and sought new allies” <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 14)</a>. In the early 2000s, Gaddafi even took part in the signing of the constitution for the African Union, which focused on the protection of human rights, promotion of democracy, defense of sovereignty, independence of member states, and the promotion of peace, security, and stability.</p>

<p>The government supported the broadening of cultural, educational, economic, and women’s rights in Libya and simultaneously provided arms to terrorist organizations throughout the world. All the while, Gaddafi insisted upon the speaking of Arabic and maintained strict control of the Internet, media, education, and public relations, which effectively isolated the country from the rest of the world <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 129)</a>. Lobban summed this up, saying “If ever there was a schizophrenic nation, it was Libya under Gaddafi. His commitment to good was outweighed by his destructive tendencies” <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 76)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="corruption"><em>Corruption</em></h3>
<p>Colonel Gaddafi is probably most well-known for his <a href="http://openanthropology.org/libya/gaddafi-green-book.pdf">Green Book</a>. Of its three tenets, two prescribed solutions to the problems of democracy and the economy. His economic solutions were socialistic. For instance, he eliminated wage systems in exchange for a partnership or income sharing structure, citizens were permitted to own their homes but nothing else, land was not to be considered private property. Thanks to the country’s oil wealth, the regime did improve public services and standards of living such that they lived far above most other averages in the region—per capita GDP in Libya was estimated at $8,400 in 2005, compared to Egypt’s at $4,400 and Tunisia’s at $7,600. The regime also utilized oil wealth for development projects such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Man-Made_River">Great Manmade River</a> project.</p>

<p>Contrary to the prescribed solution in his Green Book, though, Gaddafi, his family and cronies accumulated great quantities of land and money. Gaddafi’s sons were notorious for their spending habits and irresponsibility <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 130)</a>. He and his family controlled all media and communication outlets—”He shuts down cellular phone and Internet services at the flick of a switch” <a href="#pelham">(Pelham, 2011)</a>. Militiamen held real estate and farmland as well as power over ports and banks.</p>

<h3 id="repression"><em>Repression</em></h3>
<p>Gaddafi’s fear over being overthrown led him to intentionally weaken his armed forces by limiting their training and education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Possibly realizing that his own hold was as fragile as that of King Idris, he stopped planning for the future and began to plan for the here and now. That required dispensing with adversaries or untrustworthy subordinates. That also required ensuring that while technically sophisticated, his armed forces weren’t so well integrated that they could coherently form against him and overturn his regime <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 83)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result, militiamen were not centralized or tactical fighters, and they maintained loyalties to their respective tribes and regions. This severely crippled his defenses against rebels in 2011, as many defected under pressure. Gaddafi’s troops had significantly better weaponry, but the rebel force’s popular support was steadily growing. Additionally, his extensive stockpiles of weapons were turned against him when they fell into the hands of rebels and Islamists.</p>

<p>Gaddafi was known to celebrate those who supported him and publicly hang those who opposed him. The use of fear, repression, and special intelligence forces were common tools implemented to maintain order. Human Rights Watch alleges that 1,270 prisoners—Islamists, political rivals or otherwise—were killed when they attempted to either escape or revolt in June of 1996 <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 69)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-the-revolution-accomplished">How was the revolution accomplished?</h2>
<p>Tunisia and Egypt’s successful revolutions undoubtedly motivated the uprisings in Libya, but the unification—albeit brief—of Libyans and the assistance of the international community helped ensure that Gaddafi was permanently removed from rule.</p>

<h3 id="unification"><em>Unification</em></h3>
<p>The Libyan population is spread across a vast area—it’s the fourth largest country in Africa, with an area slightly larger than the state of Alaska. Access to the interior of the country was highly dependent on travel by airplane. Gaddafi had used this to his advantage for over 40 years, so the unification of Libyans against Gaddafi’s forces was a significant feat in the 2011 uprisings. Though communications were severely controlled and access to technology was significantly more limited than in other countries, rebels reported using the Internet to coordinate protest efforts. The ability to see each other’s successes as well as Gaddafi’s atrocities has been attributed with propelling the movement forward at a rate that caught Gaddafi’s forces off guard.</p>

<p>The arrest of a human rights lawyer, Fathi Terbil, is likely to have sparked protests in Benghazi, a city with a history of revolt against past oppressors, on February 15th, just days after Mubarak fell in Egypt. By the 17th, The Day of Revolt, protests had spread to other cities. When military forces fired on protestors, they responded with even greater force, burning government buildings and police stations. On the 20th, rebels took control of Benghazi. This got Gaddafi’s attention, and he sent jets to bomb Benghazi on February 21.</p>

<p>By the end of February, Libyans in Benghazi had formed the National Transitional Congress (NTC) and renounced Gaddafi, but Tripoli was still subject to his rule. This effectively divided the country between east and west, but the rebels continued to raid military garrisons and gather arms. In response, Gaddafi threatened that “inch by inch, room by room, house by house, alley by alley,” he would eliminate the “rats” and “cockroaches” without mercy. The severity of this language encouraged French President Nicolas Sarkozy to push for action against Gaddafi <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 132)</a>.</p>

<p>On March 5th, the NTC declared itself the “only legitimate body representing the people of Libya and the Libyan state” <a href="#aljazeera-libya">(“Battle for Libya: Key moments,” 2011)</a>. Gaddafi’s army set out toward Benghazi, intent upon crushing the resistance. The NTC’s forces deteriorated quickly under this assault, and they appealed to the international community for help.</p>

<h3 id="international-intervention"><em>International intervention</em></h3>
<p>The importance of the Libyan people’s united opposition to their authoritarian regime should not be downplayed. However, if the Arab League had not endorsed the use of air strikes by NATO and other allies, it’s quite likely that results of Libya’s uprising would have been much different. On March 17th, the UN Security Council passed resolution 1973, which authorized member states to take action to protect Libyan civilians. Patience for Gaddafi’s political unpredictability, corruption, and brutality had run out. The African Union, Arab League, neighboring states, and Libyans were tired of his unreliable promises and alliances. As Lobban notes, “This was all business. The business of getting rid of a ruler whose time had passed; whose influence had diminished and turned against his own people; whose interests lay in the retention of power for the sake of, rather than the practice of good stewardship, that differentiates good leaders from despots” <a href="#lobban">(Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, pp. 77-78)</a>.</p>

<p>On March 19, NATO began bombing campaigns led initially by the French. These campaigns effectively crippled Gaddafi’s forces and weakened supply lines. Tripoli was surrounded by NTC forces on August 16th and on August 21st Operation Mermaid Dawn is reported to have rallied all rebel troops from the west against Gaddafi in what would be his final stand. In September, the NTC’s leaders arrived in Tripoli and began their attempts to build a new government.</p>

<p>On October 20th, Gaddafi’s hometown of Sirte was captured, and the NTC confirmed that Gaddafi had died from battle wounds. However, mobile phone videos captured his death at the hands of rebel fighters. Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the leader of the NTC declared the liberation of Libya on October 23rd. Gaddafi and his son, Mutassim, were buried in an undisclosed location in the desert on October 25th.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h2>
<p>Libya’s background has some similarities to that of Tunisia and Egypt, but the most significant difference can be seen in Libyans’ egregious use of violence to combat the regime. The overthrow of Gaddafi took eight months to accomplish and cost thousands of lives. Conflicts between rebel groups during the uprising led media sources to refer to it as a civil war rather than a revolution. It would be naive to suggest that Libyans could have succeeded in overthrowing a leader known for his brutal tactics without using some degree of violence themselves. It could, however, be debated that the repercussions of using such violent means to accomplish an end will resonate within the country far longer than anyone bargained for—violence begets violence.</p>

<p>It is also noteworthy that, of the three countries being reviewed for this project, Libya is the only one in which an outside entity intervened. What caused the international community to respond here and not in Egypt or Tunisia? It’s possible that Libya’s role as one of the world’s leading oil producers is a contributing factor. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=LY">70-80%</a> is exported to European countries, and the United States also resumed imports of Libyan oil in 2004. European countries across the Mediterranean Sea also risked seeing increased volumes of refugees as a result of the conflict. What other factors do you think could have contributed to the UN and NATO’s decision? Leave your ideas in the comments.</p>
