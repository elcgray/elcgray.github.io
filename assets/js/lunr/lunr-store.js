In it, I assess the relationship between social media and the revolutions of the Arab uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya, and question whether that relationship is indicative of a broader pattern of interaction between technology and societies faced with injustice. This project was delivered as a series of blog posts and was shared with my personal social network via Facebook and Twitter.

        "title": "Building Fences: Saudi Arabia's Strategy for National Security",
        "excerpt":"     Table of Contents  Introduction  al Qaeda  Iraq  ISIL  Building Fences  Conclusion  References  IntroductionThis month, Saudi Arabia announced the completion of the first phase of a multi-billion dollar plan to help protect itself from growing instability and unrest in neighboring countries. A 900-kilometer fence has been installed along the border of Iraq equipped with other security technology such as night-vision cameras, radars, and watchtowers (“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014). This program will eventually result in the installation of fences along all Saudi Arabian borders and upgraded command and training centers for its Border Guard Forces (“Saudi arabia constructs security barrier on iraq border,” 2008).It is no coincidence that the first fence constructed was along Saudi Arabia’s border with Iraq, and its completion comes at a time when violent activity in the region to Saudi Arabia’s north is on the rise. But Saudi Arabia has its own internal struggles, as well. The country has played host to terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda, and that relationship didn’t end with the death of Osama bin Laden (“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006). Radical opposition groups still exist within the country and are actively combated by the government. To this point, it has been suggested that the fence will also help keep Saudis from crossing the border into Iraq to join jihadist movements and then return home to spread those militant ideals. This leads one to ask what the primary purpose of Saudi Arabia’s fences is. Who do they hope to keep out, who do they want to keep in, and what do these actions mean for the country’s citizens, allies, and its enemies?al QaedaSaudi Arabia became a recruitment ground for al Qaeda operations during the Afghanistan war in the 1980s. The Saudi Arabian government endorsed the jihadist organization’s activity in the beginning. By the 1990s, popular support for the group had waned; the government became less vocal in their endorsements while turning a blind eye to jihadist activity waged outside of its borders(“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006). During the Gulf War, any direct connections between al Qaeda and the Saudi government that existed were dissolved as the royal family established closer ties with the United States. Even still, al Qaeda followers in Saudi Arabia were instructed by bin Laden not to attack oil facilities—allegedly, they planned to use them as a source of finances in the future. Today, the focus has changed—energy and government infrastructures within Saudi Arabia have become primary targets of al Qaeda (“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006).Shortly after the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden waged war against the Saudi government due to its perversion of Islam and for allowing United States troops onto soil that was home to the Islam’s holy cities (Riedel &amp; Saab, 2008, p. 33). The Saudi government likely didn’t take the threats from al Qaeda seriously enough until the “explosions in Riyadh of May 2003 basically stripped them of that sense of invulnerability” (“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006) The government has since taken the offensive and aggressively combats militant groups within the country.IraqTensions between Saudi Arabia and Iraq exist for a variety of reasons. Divisions between them can be partly attributed to their differing Sunni and Shia majorities. Iraq’s suspected alliance with Iran, another distrusted neighbor, also further exacerbates tensions. Saudi Arabia’s primary concern with Iraq at this time seems to be related to its fear of potential blowback from that country’s severe instability and its ties with Shi’ite militant groups. More recently, the Saudi government accused former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki of marginalizing the country’s Sunni Arab minority and consequently creating ideal conditions for ISIL, a Sunni jihadist group, to grow rapidly (“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014). In July 2014, al-Maliki withdrew Iraqi troops from the Saudi Arabian border. Some suggest that this was done to increase pressure on Saudi Arabia and to bring the threat of ISIL to its borders (Solomon, 2014). Regardless of the intentions behind the withdrawal, unguarded borderland makes it easier for militant groups from any party to move freely and stir up greater violence within the region.ISILAnalysts suggest that private donations from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have contributed to the building of ISIL forces (Solomon, 2014) although the government denies this allegation. Another report suggests that the Saudi Arabian government recently banned its citizens from joining jihad groups in Syria (Solomon, 2014). It has, however, publicly supported other Sunni militant groups fighting in Syria in the past, and hundreds of Saudi nationals have reportedly joined ISIL regardless of the government’s stance on the group (“Saudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier,” 2014).ISIL was originally linked to al Qaeda, but in February 2014, al Qaeda announced that its tie with the group was broken, likely in an attempt to reassert its own authority in Syria’s civil war (Holmes, 2014). ISIL presents a separate threat to Saudi Arabia’s elite because its proclamation of a caliphate could diminish the validity of country’s rulers among its Sunni population (Solomon, 2014).Building FencesIn July 2014, the Saudi Arabian government expressed alarm at ISIL’s expansion in the region. However, militias from Baghdad and Iran were still regarded as bigger threats to the nation’s security (“Saudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier,” 2014). In light of such concerns, King Abdullah vowed to protect Saudi Arabia both from Sunni ISIL fighters and from Shi’ite Iraqi militias that have mobilised to fight the insurgents (“Saudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier,” 2014). In July 2014, 30,000 soldiers were deployed to border of Iraq to fill the void left by the withdrawal of Iraqi soldiers from the area (“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014).The Saudi government is investing a great deal of money in technology to combat terrorism inside and out of the nation—from fences with night vision cameras to equipment that detects poisonous gases (“Terrorism in saudi arabia,” 2006). Originally, the border security program introduced in 2006 was focused on creating a defensive line along Saudi Arabia’s border with Iraq, but by 2009 the program had been expanded to include all borders (“Saudi unveils 900km fence on iraq border,” 2014).Since 2003, military spending has increased by 13% annually (“Saudi arabia politics: Arms buying spree,” 2009). In 2008, the Saudi government allocated over $38 billion to its defense and security budget, which amounts to approximately 35% of the country’s total budget. This is more than was allocated to Saudi Arabia’s health and education spending budgets combined (“Saudi arabia politics: Arms buying spree,” 2009). The Saudi government’s spending priorities help identify another type of fence that was constructed prior to the one on the Iraqi border—that which separates governmental elites from the rest of the population.ConclusionSaudi Arabia’s leaders are very concerned with the security of the nation, and rightfully so. Surprisingly, with the exception of some small assaults, Saudi Arabia has never been invaded by a foreign enemy (David, 2008, p. 61). The United States has offered the Saudi government significant protection from such threats in previous years, but the fortification of the country’s borders suggests that the government anticipates an increasing need for protection against outside forces. However, an equally significant threat to the Saudi government’s security may come from within. Spending on technology improvements to secure borders, energy, and government infrastructures only addresses part of the problem. Though education and healthcare are provided to all Saudi citizens, the country struggles to provide employment to its growing population—the International Monetary Fund indicates that the unemployment rate among Saudi nationals reached 12% in 2013 and most private sector jobs were held by non-Saudis who are cheaper to employ (Hoetjes, 2013).Unsurprisingly, unrest grows under such circumstances and can easily be capitalized upon by extremist groups such as al Qaeda and ISIL. It could even result in an overthrow of the existing regime. Saudi malaise could be further exacerbated by the announcement that Saudi Arabia will ally with the US in opposition to ISIL and host training camps for Syrian fighters (Spencer &amp; Foster, 2014). Bin Laden was able to use just such a situation to provoke the ire of locals before. Wahhabism, the religion of the dominant majority of the population in Saudi Arabia, is known for its oppositional stance toward the West. Bin Laden was able to exploit the Saudi leadership’s alliance with the United States as an example of the religious double standards that the government held; the introduction of a half-million troops to the Arabian peninsula after the Gulf War simply underscored bin Laden’s message and provoked further rage in Saudi Arabia and in the region (David, 2008, pp. 51-54).The Saudi government’s focus on defending its borders to improve security may be an oversight; its greatest potential threat likely comes from within, and events occurring in the surrounding area could significantly increase tension. A greater focus on improving the legitimate opportunities available to its people could more effectively help the government combat homegrown terrorism. Should a serious challenge to the Saudi government arise, it would be hard for the United States to come to its rescue without potentially provoking the ire of the entire region.ReferencesSaudi arabia boosts security on heavily fortified iraq frontier.

        "excerpt":"     Table of Contents  Introduction  Background          Government Surveillance      Conflict Deterrent      Conflict Catalyst        Relevance  Strengths and Weaknesses  Conclusion  References  IntroductionInformation warfare is not new. It has always held the power to incite or to assuage conflict. A well-timed release of scathing photos or information about an opponent could be enough to turn an election in a candidate’s favor. A prime time speech announcing that another country possesses biological warfare could help gain the necessary support of a country to engage in war. Media channels played a role prior to the advent of social media, and they still do, but there is no doubt that social media has significantly altered the ways in which we interact with each other today.As is the case with most tools, social media can also be used for noble purposes, but it can also be used to spread a message of fear, of power, and control. Governments, drug cartels, and terrorist groups can use these channels and the information flowing through them with as much aptitude as their opposition. Messages can be traced back to their source. Channels can be flooded with information so that the sheer volume of content drowns out the desired message. Organizations can glean information about dissenters from social media channels and use it to verbally—and sometimes physically—threaten and harm them. The blessing and curse of social media can be seen in its ability to empower all.BackgroundIt was during Vietnam that United States citizens saw the first televised footage of war. Those images deeply disturbed the American public by bringing that war into their homes. This affected the public’s response to and support of the war in Vietnam significantly. In Rwanda, rhetoric of hate encouraging Hutus to “send Tutsis back to Ethiopia via the rivers” was spread across the country by radio in the 1990s. Those words were followed by action and resulted in a genocide that claimed nearly a million lives in a matter of a few months.Radio and television are still incredibly powerful mediums, but the news media circle is now adjoined by a variety of social media platforms—Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, for example—and what they bring to the table is different than that of their more formal counterparts. Most notably, it can deliver information to an audience in real-time. Censorship of social media, though still feasible, is increasingly difficult. When one video gets taken down, you need only to search by keywords to locate another copy that hasn’t yet been removed. Here are a few examples of social media’s role in conflict.Government SurveillanceIt’s long been known that the US uses surveillance information to anticipate threats to national security. A recent article detailed the Pentagon’s use of social science data to develop tools that can be used to “model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world” (Ahmed, 2014). The Department of Defense launched the Minerva Research Initiative in 2008 in order to better understand the socio-political, cultural, and behavioral aspects of “strategically significant” areas of the world. The 2011 Egyptian revolution, 2013 Gazi park protests, and more are being used to try to identify the kinds of people who are involved in a “social contagion” and when that shift occurs. This is part of an effort to determine the tipping point of such events (Ahmed, 2014). The author of the article expresses concern about the way in which data—including that gathered from social media resources—was being used to identify threats to national security, noting that “Minerva is a prime example of the deeply narrow-minded and self-defeating nature of military ideology. Worse still, the unwillingness of DoD officials to answer the most basic questions is symptomatic of a simple fact – in their unswerving mission to defend an increasingly unpopular global system serving the interests of a tiny minority, security agencies have no qualms about painting the rest of us as potential terrorists” (Ahmed, 2014).Conflict DeterrentSocial scientists and police are using social media to combat gang violence in Chicago, which has struggled to reduce its homicide rate, regardless of trends downward in other large cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Recent studies found that people in high-crime, high-risk neighborhoods had a 900% greater likelihood to be victims of homicide if they participated in a social network (Moser, 2013). The Chicago Police Department (CPD) is now using social media tools to map relationships between the city’s most active gang members in an attempt to defuse potential “hot spots” situations that could result in homicides; this use of network analysis and “focused deterrence” helped police identify connections between individuals and figure out who was at risk. Initial results of this change of approach seem to indicate that it’s been effective, though a long-term determination on the impact of social-networking policing is still necessary (Buntin, 2013).Conflict CatalystA 14-year old girl was shot and killed by her friend after a Facebook fight escalated (Endia Martin’s Death Exposes Entrenched Chicago Violence, 2014). Individual acts of violence that started out as online spats and quickly evolved into physical altercations are not uncommon. Social media has proven itself to be a tool capable of escalating or augmenting conflict rapidly. It has also become an invaluable tool of revolutionary movements, allowing individuals to unite in solidarity for a cause, regardless of their geographic location. Momentum can grow exponentially, and once a critical mass has been gained, it is difficult for the opposition of such a movement to stop it. The Egyptian government felt the power of such a movement when they tried to stop rioters by shutting down access to the Internet in 2011 (Ackerman, 2011); this only drew more people out into the streets in protest and greater attention from major news outlets worldwide. President Mubarak and his government were removed from power shortly thereafter.RelevanceOpinions on the significance of social media’s role in conflict run the gamut. Ems emphasizes that political protests of today have arisen from “the complexity of intertwined social and technological” realms. New media communications tools are presented as resources that can be used to augment, expose, motivate, and democratize a global, socio-technical audience (Ems, 2014). Fuchs offers a more critical view of the role of social media in conflict. He investigates claims from mass media that social media played an integral role in the 2011 UK riots and the Arab Spring, arguing instead that it distracts from the true issues at hand (Fuchs, 2012). He suggests that we must first analyze the societal structures that frame and condition actions, including the use of technology. The base of his article focuses on the role of societal structure, its stratification, and social deprivation in the UK and Egypt as the preliminary factors of the riots and uprisings. His conclusion asserts that “what happens in a crisis is never just or fair, but an expression of the structural violence built into the system (Fuchs, 2012)”. Murthy, in considering the role of social media tool, Twitter, in society, posited that “the power of the medium is that profound tweets also appear side by side with banal ones – second by second, minute by minute, and hour by hour” (Murthy, 2011). He cautioned that there are limits to the tool’s reach, as its audience is strongly socioeconomically stratified (Murthy, 2011).Strengths and WeaknessesCammaerts’ assessment of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in society found that its everyday uses have increased exponentially. However, he warns that we need to remain critical of unfounded claims about the ways in which social media can revolutionize the economic, cultural, and political aspects of society. He emphasizes that the changes that have taken place with social media seemingly at the helm are part of a more complex, historical process (Cammaerts, 2005). Cammaerts concludes that there are plausible optimistic and pessimistic views of ICT use in social movements and democracy. He acknowledges that the Internet is an essential component of many transnational organizations, but he also emphasizes that the offline aspects of those organizations are important factors. “Each time we find a pattern that points to conflicting findings. Discontinuity and agency in some practices, and at the same time (structural) continuities in others (Cammaerts, 2005)”.Chouliaraki focuses on the manifestations of solidarity movements via social media and asserts that “the disposition of ‘I have a voice’ is an ambivalent one, in that it can both catalyse change and reproduce power relations between West and global South (Chouliaraki, 2013)”. She describes the dimensions of this process, starting with re-mediation—the presence of a community’s voice in major news networks. Then comes the inter-mediation of social media, where the voices on global topics of concern are organized. After that, trans-mediation occurs, where the voice moves from a symbolic to a physical realm of action. She concludes that “insofar as convergent journalism remains embedded in structures of iterability that reproduce the dominant visions and divisions of community, cosmopolitan solidarity will remain, at best, a rare moment of revolutionary resonance between the West and its others, or, at worst, a narcissistic reverberation of our own pity for these others’ suffering (Chouliaraki, 2013)”.ConclusionThe power of media to provoke or abate conflict is historically significant. Social media follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, but the speed at which it can gain momentum makes it an especially sharp double-edged sword. Social media most definitely plays a vital role in conflict, but it is just one component in an incredibly complex social system. Those that wield social media as a weapon in conflict must be careful not to injure themselves or those they care about in the process. We all have an increasingly serious responsibility to pay attention to our governments, our peers, and our own uses of social media in conflict. We should strive to make conscious decisions on how to use social media tools to communicate, organize, and improve our deeply interconnected societal systems.ReferencesEndia Martin’s Death Exposes Entrenched Chicago Violence.

        "excerpt":"     Table of Contents  Introduction  Rwanda          History      United States Aid and Involvement        Bosnia          History        United States Aid and Involvement  Conclusion          At Arm’s Length      Media Influence      Final Thoughts        References  IntroductionActions may speak louder than words, but sometimes words (or the lack thereof) are equally as poignant. The word “genocide” is one that weighs heavily on the human conscience. It carries with it the guilt of past atrocities committed against fellow mankind and a promise to ourselves that we will not allow it to happen again. Realistically, though, genocide has occurred more than once. It continues to occur in modern society, and the media connects us to such atrocities more effectively than ever before.Though they weren’t alone in their inaction, the United States’ response to signs of genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda in the 1990s were inconsistent with the promise to never again allow the horror of genocide to spread. The United States government’s words and its actions left much to interpretation by those involved in the atrocities as well as those on the outside looking in. A study of the language used in regard to these tragedies as well as the forms and the duration of aid provided expose patterns in US foreign policy toward the Rwandan and Bosnian genocides.RwandaHistoryThe class structure of the Tutsi elite minority and the Hutu majority was established and reinforced by the German and Belgian governments in the early 1900s, and this was likely the start of the ethnic rivalry that was to come to a head in the 1990s. Hutus rebelled against the established Tutsi elite in 1959 and took power over the government by 1962. From this point on, affronts on the Tutsis occurred within Rwanda, pushing most of the Tutsi population out of Rwanda and actively restricting or excluding those who remained from participation in government functions throughout the 1970s and 1980s (“Rwanda Chronology,” 2013).By 1986, exiled Tutsis from Rwanda participated in the overthrow of Ugandan dictator Milton Obote and formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). These united forces invaded Rwanda in 1990 (Goose &amp; Smyth, 1994, p. 88) and war between the Rwandan army and the RPF continued until a cease-fire in March of 1991, which included a promise to establish a multi-party system that would respect Hutus and Tutsis alike. Contrary to this agreement, Tutsis continued to be murdered throughout the country and hateful rhetoric encouraging Hutus to send the Tutsis “back to Ethiopia” via the rivers spread.In August of 1993, the UN deployed troops to ensure the implementation of a peace accord that would establish a timeframe for the return of refugees as well as the creation of a joint Hutu-RPF government, but this process was stalled into 1994. During this delay, Hutu militias continued to train, and rhetoric encouraging the extermination of Tutsis escalated, disseminating its message of hate via radio waves.On April 6, 1994, Hutu President Habyarimana’s plane was allegedly shot down by extremists that suspected the president was on his way to finally formalize the peace accords started in 1991 (Moose &amp; Harper, 1994, p. 3). The mass killings of Tutsis as well as moderate Hutu politicians by Hutu forces began that evening while UN troops, charged only with monitoring the situation, failed to intervene. The RPF responded in reaction to the mass slaughter of Tutsis with significant force. Two weeks later, as the violence escalated, the UN reduced its presence by 90 percent, leaving only a few hundred remaining in the country (“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 67).By the end of April, over a quarter of a million Rwandans had fled the country and the UN Security Council began to discuss their approach to the crisis. It wasn’t until May 17, 1994, that the UN used the word “genocide” to describe the crisis in Rwanda. UN-backed troops were not deployed to Rwanda until July of 1994. By this time, over 600,000 Rwandans had been killed (“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 45), and the murder of both Hutus and Tutsis continued within the country and in refugee camps even after UN forces arrived.In February of 1995, financial commitments were made, but tension increased between the Rwandan government and the UN over a lack of delivery on the promised international aid. The Rwandan government requested in June of 1995 that the UN withdraw their troops; the UN Security Council cut their troop presence by over half. Though a tribunal was established in November of 1994, the first case in the Rwandan genocide trials did not begin until January of 1997; they have continued in the years since (“Rwanda Chronology,” 2013).United States Aid and InvolvementPresident Clinton released a statement on April 7, 1994, expressing his shock and grief over the death of the Rwandan president. He strongly condemned the violence that followed and called on the warring parties to cease “such actions” immediately (Clinton, 1994). Four days later, a private memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle East/Africa to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy identified that the government was unwilling to get involved inside of Rwanda until peace was restored and that they planned to restart their security assistance program once that occurred. In the meantime, the State planned to limit its involvement in the Rwandan conflict to statements in support of the UN, France, and Belgium’s efforts to resume the peace process. They acknowledged internally that a “massive bloodbath” would likely occur if peace talks were not resumed (“Cable number 099440, to US Mission to the United Nations, New York. ‘Talking Points for UNAMIR Withdrawal,’” 1994, pp. 2-3).By the 15th of April, the US Department of State had instructed US diplomats to encourage the withdrawal of all United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) presence from the country, offering that “experience suggests that any serious negotiations among the parties will take place outside Rwanda; therefore, UN Security Forces will not be required” (“Cable number 099440, to US Mission to the United Nations, New York. ‘Talking Points for UNAMIR Withdrawal,’” 1994, p. 4). However, on May 1st, discussion points made by the Department of Defense identified that great care was being taken not to refer to the escalating violence in Rwanda as a “genocide,” since such a “finding could commit USG [United States Government] to actually ‘do something’” (“Discussion Paper,” 1994, p. 1). Within the same discussion points, it was acknowledged that the “present force does not have the manpower or equipment” to protect refugees and that there was “no support at present for increasing either the size or equipment of the UN PKO [Peacekeeping Operations] force” (“Discussion Paper,” 1994, p. 2). Finally, regarding the US embargo on Rwanda, this document noted in bold that they did not “envision it will have a significant impact on the killings because machetes, knives and other hand implements have been the most common weapons” (“Discussion Paper,” 1994, p. 3).The United States was involved from the start in the UN Security council discussions regarding the Rwandan crisis and contributed troops and funds to the effort. Despite the fact that the UN deemed the crisis in Rwanda to be a genocide in May, it wasn’t until June of 1994 that the US government publicly acknowledged the killings as a genocide.The United States began its humanitarian efforts to Rwandan refugees in August of 1994. US monetary aid allocated to the Rwandan government in 1995 amounted to $60 million, one tenth of the total amount pledged by Western governments (“Rwanda Chronology,” 2013). Jeff Drumtra, Africa Policy Analyst for the U.S. Committee for Refugees, criticized these aid efforts in his prepared statement for a Congressional hearing on July 26, 1994, saying that  “Average Americans’ unfortunate stereotypes about tribal African wars masked the reality of what was happening in Rwanda and immobilized the public’s response. Public financial contributions to Rwandan relief efforts were meager through June, according to InterAction, the umbrella agency for American relief organizations. The Administration did not communicate the stark, one-sided nature of the killings, or that events in Rwanda represented one of history’s greatest crimes. The Administration did not elevate this crisis to priority status, and thus neither did the public” (“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 68).BosniaHistoryThe region in Europe where Bosnia lies has also had its share of conflict throughout history. Serbs and Croats belonged to different cultural and religious backgrounds associated with eastern orthodoxy and Catholicism, while Bosnia’s religion and culture was strongly influenced by the Ottoman Empire, its inhabitants practicing Islam (Garde, 1998). This resulted in three distinct ethnicities with different national allegiances cohabitating in an area that falls on the dividing line between the eastern and western world.In the early 1900s, Bosnia-Herzegovina became an annex of Austria-Hungary. The assassination of the Austrian archduke, which occurred in Sarajevo, was a critical component to the start of the First World War. During World War II, thousands of Muslims and Bosnians were killed by Croatian fascists allied with the Nazis. Simultaneously, Muslims and Croats were being killed by Serbian nationalists (Garde, 1998). Some semblance of stability was introduced in 1945 when Bosnia became a republic as part of the Yugoslav Socialist Federation. It became apparent over time that the communist regime was the only truly autonomous power in the federation, and it determined which leaders had control within the republics, each representing a different ethnic group (Garde, 1998).Consequently, the collapse of communism in the Balkan region in the late 1980s resulted in the establishment of a coalition government comprised of parties with distinctly different end goals. Muslims wished for an independent Bosnian state, Croats wished for an independent Croatian state and the Serbs envisioned a unified Yugoslavian territory effectively behaving as a greater Serbian state (Garde, 1998). War broke out in full force after Muslims and Croats proclaimed their independence in 1991. It was at this time that the Serbs began the process of ethnic cleansing–the forced expulsion of undesired ethnic or religious groups by means such as arson, rape and murder–and established the Republika Srpska (“Bosnia-Hercegovina timeline,” 2012).By 1993, increased tensions turned Muslims against Croats, further complicating the war inside of Bosnia where alliances between Muslims and Serbs were formed against Croats, and Croats and Serbs against Muslims. It was at this point that the UN established safe havens in Gorazde, Srebrenica and Sarajevo for Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks) within the disputed territory of Bosnia (“Bosnia-Hercegovina timeline,” 2012).The mass killing of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in the safe haven of Srebrenica, regardless of the UN presence in the area, led to NATO involvement in 1995 and the creation of the Dayton Peace Accord, which was signed by the three warring parties’ leaders. The Accord decreed that the country be split, providing space for the Bosniaks and Croats on one side and the Bosnian Serbs on the other. It also mandated that peacekeeping forces be deployed (Clinton, 1995, p. 1777). Moreover, the UN designated someone to act as High Representative to oversee the country’s implementation of the mandates within the Dayton Peace Accord; this position still functions within Bosnia Herzegovina today (“Ohr Introduction,” 2012). A tribunal was established in 1996, and the first conviction for war crimes was tried that year. In the years to come, individuals from all three warring parties would be tried and convicted of war crimes (“Bosnia-Hercegovina timeline,” 2012).United States Aid and InvolvementIn October of 1992, President Bush issued a statement detailing the US’ humanitarian assistance to Bosnia. The US was collaborating with the UN on the implementation of a trade embargo, and UN forces had been deployed in order to deliver relief supplies to the Bosnian people. President Bush acknowledged that  “Despite agreements reached at the London conference, Bosnian cities remain under siege, the movement of humanitarian relief convoys is still hazardous, and innocent civilians continue to be slaughtered…There is no easy solution to the Bosnian conflict, let alone the larger Balkan crisis. So we will persist in our strategy of containing and reducing the violence, making the aggressors pay, and relieving the suffering of victims, all the while lending our full support to the quest for a settlement. History shows that what this troubled region needs is not more violence but peaceful change, and I am confident that the steps I am announcing today will help the innocent victims, strengthen the hand of the negotiators and reinforce the pressures for peace” (Bush, 1992, pp. 1738-1739).On May 10, 1994, the arms embargo was lifted on Bosnia-Herzegovina, allowing Bosnian troops to arm themselves in defense against the Serb army more effectively. Senator Simpson underscored this point, noting that “We are not sending Americans to fight in Bosnia if we pass this measure. We are merely permitting Bosnians to defend themselves”(“Lifting the Arms Embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina,” 1994). Petitions were made for further intervention in the years leading up to the attack on the Srebrenica safe haven in 1995, but involvement stayed at the peacekeeping level with no intervention in the conflict.On November 21, 1995, President Clinton announced the agreement made in the Dayton Peace Accord, stating that, “After nearly 4 years of 250,000 people killed, 2 million refugees, atrocities that have appalled people all over the world, the people of Bosnia finally have a chance to turn from the horror of war to the promise of peace” (Clinton, 1995, p. 1776). A week later, he addressed the nation again, emphasizing that  “America’s role will not be about fighting a war. It will be about helping the people of Bosnia to secure their own peace agreement. Our mission will be limited, focused, and under the command of an American general. In fulfilling this mission, we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilians, especially children, and at the same time, to bring stability to Central Europe, a region of the world that is vital to our national interests. It is the right thing to do…Horrors we prayed had been banished from Europe forever have been seared into our minds again: skeletal prisoners caged behind barbed-wire fences; women and girls raped as a tool of war; defenseless men and boys shot down into mass graves, evoking visions of World War II concentration camps; and endless lines of refugees marching toward a future of despair…The only force capable of getting this job done is NATO, the powerful military alliance of democracies that has guaranteed our security for half a century now. And as NATO’s leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement, the United States must be an essential part of the mission. If we’re not there, NATO will not be there; the peace will collapse; the war will reignite; the slaughter of innocents will begin again” (Clinton, 1995, pp. 1784-1785).Bosnia-Herzegovina is still being monitored and supported with humanitarian aid today, though these responsibilities were mostly transferred to the European Union with the EU’s recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a potential candidate for accession in 2003 (“EU relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina,” never-again).ConclusionAt Arm’s LengthThe State utilized a similar approach to foreign policy in both Rwanda and in Bosnia, particularly in its reluctance to assist on the ground until pressure built enough that it was imperative. For instance, the United States exhibited a propensity toward the establishment of arms embargoes as a primary means of response to conflict in both Bosnia and Rwanda. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s ambassador to Pakistan, Sadzida Siladjzic, criticized this approach, saying  “Unfortunately all the powers which were supposed to create peace in the world have changed into humanitarian aid organizations which are not doing anything. We did not request to be fed and then killed. We did not ask for it. From the very beginning, we had been always telling them that we did not want food; we wanted arms. But they still feed us” (Siladjzic, 1994, p. 11).The US was also averse to identifying either of these crises as genocides until it became a matter of credibility with human rights organizations and the public. For example, the topic of language in reference to these crises was brought up for discussion on May 21st in a private memorandum, and it was determined that, in order to maintain credibility with human rights groups and the public, the State Department should be allowed to publicly conclude that “acts of genocide have occurred” in Rwanda. This was the same formulation being used in regard to Bosnia, though in Bosnia it could be stated that genocide was “taking place” (Moose, Shattuck, Bennet, &amp; Harper, 2013).Such debate around semantics reinforces the US government’s unwillingness to commit to language that would necessitate that they become involved in these conflicts any sooner than required. Speaking to the perceived inaction of the government in Rwanda, Representative Hastings asserted during a Congressional hearing on June 8, 1994 that  “More people have died in 5 weeks in Rwanda than died in Bosnia, and I think that we have been ineffective in Bosnia as well. I suspect that if something like this were taking place in England or France that the whole world would stop and attend to it that day…Obviously, the killers feel that they can get away with it because nobody is doing anything. And by the time we get ready to do something there is nothing left to be done because every damn body is dead. I mean, you know, it is mind boggling” (“Conflict resolution in Africa: Recent developments : hearing and markup before the Subcommittee on Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, One Hundred Third Congress, second session, on H.R. 4541 …  8 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1995, p. 16).Media InfluenceAnother similarity that reveals itself as a force to be reckoned with in future conflicts is the role of the media in the dissemination of information. The media was aggressively used as a tool of war by the Serbs against the Croatians and Bosniaks. Christopher Bennett detailed this, stating that  “Media has arguably been the most destructive weapon in the wars of Yugoslav dissolution. Indeed, it is said in the former Yugoslavia that all victims died twice: first on television and then in reality…The Serb national psyche which has so revolted the world since 1991 is not the product of centuries of historical evolution. It has been deliberately manufactured and intensively cultivated by the Serbian media since 1987…More important than what was or was not actually happening in Yugoslavia in the run up to and during the war were perceptions of what was taking place. These depended not on real events but on an atmosphere created by the rival media. As the various republican leaders adopted increasingly antagonistic positions, so did the media they controlled. It was a vicious cycle” (Bennett, 1998).Media was also used by the Hutus to spread hateful rhetoric against the Tutsis. Roméo Dallaire noted in this regard that “the genocidaires used the media like a weapon. The haunting image of killers with a machete in one hand and radio in the other never leaves you” (Thompson, Annan, &amp; Centre, 2008, p. 12).The international media’s portrayal of the wars in Bosnia and Rwanda played a significant role in the public’s involvement, or the lack thereof. Samantha Power argued that modern media may, in fact, make intervention less likely, noting that  “On the one hand, as we saw in Bosnia and Rwanda, the publicity given to mass atrocity can attract public interest and pull foreign governments toward intervention. On the other hand, the seeming intractability of the hatreds, the sight of the carnage, the visible danger to anyone who sets foot in the region, and the apparent remoteness of events from American homes can repel American voters and leaders and keep American troops out. In effect, this very tension may explain the United States’ tendency to deliver a hearty humanitarian response but nonexistent military response to genocide” (Power, 1998).Final ThoughtsThe actions of the US government in response to the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda are subject to great criticism in retrospect. While the State refused to acknowledge the presence of genocide in Europe and in Africa, the media revealed to the world the extent of the brutality that was being committed while simultaneously underscoring the power it can give to those who wish to motivate people for evil purposes. There is, no doubt, a great deal of pressure attached to being the remaining superpower in a world that is filled with tragedy and strife. Any desire to immediately assist those in need will likely be overshadowed by the pain or regret of mistakes of the past.The mistakes of foreign aid efforts in the 1990s must not be forgotten. The US government would be wise to consider, at the very least, the value of transparency based on their experiences in Bosnia and in Rwanda.In a world where social media is ever-prevalent, denial of atrocities in Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt or Turkey will not hold for long. The greatest danger of ambiguity is damage to the credibility of institutions such as the UN and NATO that were founded with the desire to protect and empower the world’s citizens. When those institutions use politics and word games to defer responsibility, they empower the oppressors and they lose the trust of their constituents. The oppressed, when pushed to the point of desperation, will eventually decide to take justice into their own hands, and that risks even greater levels of conflict worldwide.We can’t afford to keep tragedy at arm’s length in a world that is now so tightly–and digitally–interwoven. Senator James Jeffords spoke to this point during a Congressional hearing in July of 1994, stating “Words not backed up by deeds serve merely to embolden the aggressor. We all agree that gunboat diplomacy is not the way for the United States to conduct itself in the world, but I am concerned that by failing to act decisively in certain crises, we are sinking into a pattern of lifeboat diplomacy” (“Crisis in Central Africa: Hearing before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session,  26 Washington: U.S. G.P.O,” 1994, p. 4).ReferencesRwanda Chronology.

        "excerpt":"     Table of Contents  A Culture of Violence  Mexico Today          Organized Crime      Police and Military Violence      Vigilante Justice        Public Reactions to Violence          Government      National and Social Media        Development in Areas of Conflict  Conclusion  Reference  A Culture of ViolenceIn 2011, the UNDP’s administrator, Helen Clark, spoke on the issue of pervasive violence in Latin America, saying that “transnational criminal organizations pose a huge threat to state security institutions whose mandate is limited to the national context…Societies and states are sometimes tempted to use illegal means to fight crime, and the public debate on insecurity can become unduly polarized (“Crime poses major threat to Latin America’s progress, says UNDP chief,” 2011).” It was estimated that more than 18,000 people were murdered in Central America alone in 2010 (“Young Latin Americans welcome future with optimism, but demand less corruption, poverty and violence,” 2013). This underscores the severity of an issue that affects an entire region. However, Mexico’s culture of violence has garnered a significant amount of attention in the past decade as the expanse of its reach becomes more evident. In 2011, the Los Angeles Times cited government intelligence figures stating that 40,000 people have been killed since 2006 as a result of the expanding drug war (Wilkinson, 2012); other sources near 100,000 with their estimates (Kirchner, 2014). This paper will consider whether or not there is a correlation between a culture of violence and the status of development efforts in those areas most significantly affected by conflict.Mexico TodayOrganized CrimeOrganized crime is the most natural entity to blame for the violence and fear that maintains a stranglehold on swaths of Mexican society today. In 2013, the state of Guerrero, located in the southwest of Mexico and home to Acapulco, ranked highest in number of homicides in Mexico, and it held the second-highest number of kidnappings (missing reference). Neighboring state, Michoacán, is equally infamous for high levels of conflict and corruption at the hand of the Knights Templar. Such troubles are not isolated to the Pacific regions of Mexico, however. The state of Tamaulipas on the US-Mexican border has recently seen an increase in violence related to organized crime. In April 2014, it is reported that approximately 70 people, including a federal official and some bystanders, were killed; 17 deaths occurred in one day in the border city of Reynosa (“Violence related with organized crime grows in Tamaulipas,” 2014). Unfortunately, organized crime does not account for all of the violence that citizens witness.Police and Military ViolenceJuan Méndez, a UN Special Rapporteur on torture and inhuman treatment or punishment released a report at the beginning of May 2014, stating, “there is a kind of endemic torture to be corrected,” and that it was widespread within all Mexican law enforcement corporations. He went on to emphasize that the government “is on the track to correct it” (“Torture is widespread within Mexican police: UN,” 2014) Méndez also expressed concern about increasing militarization in some regions of Mexico, such as Michoacán.Violent military and police tactics may have increased in response to increasingly aggressive cartels, or reports of such behavior could be a byproduct of the reported corruption of regional police forces (Hernandez, 2012). Regardless, this takes its toll on citizens’ trust in military and police forces as protectors of their freedom and security. The UNDP’s 2013 Youth Expectations Index revealed that “young people from Mexico, Portugal and Spain expressed the lowest levels of confidence in their institutions (police, government, politicians, justice, media, universities, social organizations and democratic institutions)” (“Young Latin Americans welcome future with optimism, but demand less corruption, poverty and violence,” 2013) When confidence in formal institutions is diminished, people are more likely to build their own social structures to fill the void.Vigilante JusticeCommunities terrorized by organized crime and distrustful of their own police forces have been backed into a corner. This has resulted in an increase in vigilantism–a measure deemed necessary to fill a void in security. The organization of autodefensas —vigilante “self-defense” militias— has increased in Guerrero as a result of greater violent conflict in the region.Earlier this year, President Peña Nieto deployed thousands of federal troops and police to Michoacán to deter clashes between autodefensas and the Knights Templar cartel (Fausset, 2014). In some areas, the autodefensas and the military unite against organized crime, but trust is a delicate issue as is the issue of power. A local leader in Guerrero warned, “if a social movement arms itself, we know when they take up arms, but we don’t know when they’ll put them down, nor at what cost” (Fausset, 2014). Communities cautiously trust those who say they stand for their rights and security of the people, but they appear cynical about the enduring allegiance of such groups.The consequences of this complex power struggle are numerous, but the most significant damage has been done to trust. Citizens caught in hot bed regions for violence can no longer trust that their neighbor is not a spy, and federal officers replace local security forces, which have succumbed to corruption (Fausset, 2014). This poses a significant hurdle for development efforts because it illustrates a systemic issue. Trust has been corroded so greatly that citizens do not believe in the institutions that they rely upon, the federal government suspects that some vigilante groups are actually backed by rival drug cartels (Fausset &amp; Sanchez, 2014), and autodefensas have been known to betray the communities that have embraced them. It is nearly impossible to imagine that development efforts could succeed under such difficult circumstances, but Mexico’s history proves that its people are not the kind to surrender without a fight.Public Reactions to ViolenceGovernmentAs a fairly recent member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), (“List of OECD Member countries,” n.d.) Mexico has worked hard to get to where it is economically, and the toll of violence is not isolated to the political and social realms. That being said, the government’s response to accounts of increasing violence can be seen as both politically and economically strategic. During a Conference of the Mexican Episcopate (CEM) in May 2014, President Peña Nieto shared statistics, which illustrate that crime rates have actually decreased within the country. However, instability in the states of Michoacán, Guerrero and Tamaulipas was acknowledged, and both the President and religious leaders in attendance united in their stance toward the disarmament of autodefensas and a return to reliance upon government authorities (Sanchez, 2014).The federal government has also released their National Public Safety Program for 2014 - 2018, identifying six areas focused on the reversal of national security concerns, which increased by 93% between 2006 and 2012. These areas involve using technology to identify and track high-profile criminals after they leave prison, improving border security by adding additional police, creating regional intelligence centers that will research organized crime, creating new police academies, and increasing wages and benefits of the police (Otero, 2014). Finally, a reform was recently passed, which will allow members of the military who commit crimes against citizens to be tried in civilian courts. Prison reform, which focuses on providing necessities for proper reintegration into society, is also taking place (Jimenez &amp; Nieto, 2014). These efforts are a critical step toward addressing the public’s concern and distrust of military and police corruption and have the potential to be incredibly impactful.National and Social MediaMexico has a history full of revolutionaries who have taken stances against injustice in whatever form it takes. It, then, should come as no surprise that violence within Mexico has been taken on by both national and social media. The Los Angeles Times warns that “Mexico has become one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, especially those covering issues involving corruption, the drug war and political misconduct” (Wilkinson, 2012) To make things worse, it’s been reported by human rights organizations that authorities have rarely investigated the killings or kidnappings of journalists, likely due to corruption in regional forces. This has significantly impacted the way that news is covered in Mexico. For instance, an attack was waged on the office of El Mañana, a newspaper in Nuevo Laredo, a border town in the state of Tamaulipas. El Mañana, surrounded by powerful cartels and regular displays of violence, took the threats issued to them seriously and announced the next day that they would no longer report on “violent disputes” (Wilkinson, 2012) Similar cases have occurred throughout the country, leaving citizens with fewer formal ways to get information about what is going on around them.In much the same way that autodefensas organized themselves to fill a security vacuum in their neighborhoods, individual citizens have taken to social media to fill the information vacuum left by the censorship of the media. Twitter hashtags have been created for different towns, allowing users to function as an informal sort of news service (Kirchner, 2014). Unsurprisingly, cartels have also embraced social media as a means of distributing their messages of intimidation and fear, and anonymity online is not as anonymous as one would like to believe. YouTube videos have been posted of gang executions (Kirchner, 2014), and blatant threats toward “Internet snitches” have been issued in gruesome forms. In Nuevo Laredo two people who posted messages on popular sites that aggregate reports of drug-related violence were murdered and put on display with a note warning of similar action against others speaking out against the cartels (Goodman, 2011).Citizens using social media for the distribution of news also risk legal repercussions. For instance, two people in Veracruz found themselves in trouble for inadvertently passing a rumor along that resulted in mass panic; they were charged with terrorism and sabotage but later released (Goodman, 2011). Amnesty International summed this situation up well, saying that the drug war “creates a climate of distrust in which rumors circulate on social media as people try to protect themselves, because there is no reliable information available” (Goodman, 2011).What’s more concerning is that a recent study suggests that there is a relationship between the persistent violence in Mexico and increased desensitization. The research focused primarily on the cities of Monterrey, Reynosa, Saltillo and Veracruz and used data from Twitter to monitor the affect and expression of emotion in posts as violence increased (of Technology, 2014). In the report’s conclusion, the researchers stated that “While violence was on the rise in our regions of interest, our findings showed a decline in negative affect as well as a rise in emotional arousal and dominance in Twitter posts: aspects that are known to be psychological correlates of desensitization” (Choudhury, M., &amp; Mark, 2014). The also offered up an alternative explanation that sounds all too familiar–“it is also possible that people have started to self- censor their Twitter posts out of fear of retaliation—an aspect that may manifest as desensitization” (Choudhury, M., &amp; Mark, 2014).While technology implementation is often heralded as a sort of panacea for development efforts, it can have unintended consequences. Social media is a magnifier, capable of increasing the range and volume of a message’s distribution and its resultant effects, whether positive or negative. Messages of fear and solidarity are capable of spreading, one just as quickly the other, and they are hard to contain once they have been disseminated. This adds an additional level of complexity to the challenge of development in areas of conflict.Development in Areas of ConflictA brief look at homicide rates in comparison to illiteracy and population growth rates for the states of Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Michoacán, and Guerrero suggests that, with further research, a correlation between violence and development growth could be established.Table 1. Comparison between state homicide, illiteracy, and population growth rates (“Mexico in Numbers” 2014)            State      Homicides (2010)      Homicide Rate per 100k (2010)      Illiteracy Rate (2010)      Total Population (2010)      Population Growth Rate(2010)                  Nuevo Leon      1287      27.66      2.2      4653458      1.9              Tamaulipas      1307      39.99      3.61      3268554      1.7              Michoacan      2029      46.63      10.18      4351037      0.9              Guerrero      2085      61.53      16.68      3388768      0.9      The numbers above illustrate that states with the lowest homicide rates have the lowest rates of illiteracy and more significant population growth than states with higher homicide rates. It’s been reported that in areas with high levels of violence, such as Veracruz, parents are more likely to pull children from school, or schools have been shut down entirely (Wilkinson, 2012). This undoubtedly affects development in education and could impact illiteracy rates as a result.ConclusionA culture of violence does have the potential to negatively impact development efforts. However, the resilience of the Mexican people is inspiring. When institutions fail to protect the public or disallow them from speaking out against injustice, citizens create their own informal institutions to fill the vacuum. Acemoglu and Robinson noted that “the exact path of institutional development during these periods depends on which one of the opposing forces will succeed, which groups will be able to form effective coalitions, and which leaders will be able to structure events to their advantage” (Acemoglu &amp; Robinson, 2013). Mexico is at a critical juncture. Generations-old extractive institutions are being challenged, and things have gotten ugly along the way, but there is still potential to overcome them. Promotion and protection of health, safety, and education are paramount to improved development in Mexico, and the current government has taken a significant amount of action toward improving transparency and extending the reach of social services to the public. Based on the historic resilience and determination of Mexico’s people, I am cautiously optimistic of their future.ReferenceYoung Latin Americans welcome future with optimism, but demand less corruption, poverty and violence.

        "excerpt":"“The people want the fall of the regime.”Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year old Tunisian fruit vendor, set himself on fire in a final act of protest after being harassed and beaten by the police. This action, which took place on December 17, 2010, is viewed as the spark that ignited a revolutionary movement. People took to the streets in opposition to the dictatorial regime of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, which had stripped Bouazizi and many other Tunisians of justice and dignity over the course of 23 years. YouTube and cell phone videos spread the news that others were demonstrating against the regime and made the violence of Ben Ali’s security forces more apparent. The people could no longer be placated by promises of economic relief. Then, after being ordered to fire on demonstrators, the military turned on Ben Ali who resigned and fled the country on January 14, 2011—less than a month after Bouazizi’s self immolation.Not two weeks after, Egypt’s Day of Revolt on January 25, 2011 made it clear that what was happening was the start of something bigger than a sporadic outburst of discontent; within a month, protests had also begun in Yemen, Sudan, Bahrain, and Libya. The cry heard around the world was clear:  الشعب يريد إسقاط النظام‎Ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam(The people want the fall of the regime)This message was—and continues to be—disseminated via social media channels like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter in countries such as Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. It’s been over four years since the initial uprisings, and the embers of emancipation are still glowing throughout the Middle East/North African (MENA) region today, though the tone and the pace of change varies.Social media’s roleIt’s undeniable that social media has played a role in the MENA uprisings, but what role it has played is still a matter of debate. Some posit that social media was the driver behind the revolutions while others argue that it was only a component in a much more complex system and an echo of the past.This project intends to further inspect the relationship(s) between social media and the revolutions of the Arab Spring in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya as some of the first countries impacted by this movement. I will review the background of these countries to see which factors may have contributed to the uprisings. Then, I’ll assess public analyses of social media’s historic role in the movements as well as its current function in the three countries. Finally, I’ll consider the status of the governments’ democratic efforts to date. Each of these topics will be addressed by country in individual blog posts, so there will be three background posts—one for Tunisia, one for Egypt, and one for Libya—and so on.Why this mattersThe review of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya’s histories and the assessment of their present-day situations will be used to better understand what makes a revolutionary movement—particularly one involving social media—take hold more effectively in some places than in others. A more comprehensive perspective on the role of social media in conflict is of significant importance today as governments fund research programs that “model the dynamics, risks and tipping points for large-scale civil unrest across the world” (Ahmed, 2014), develop software that spread propaganda via social media (Fielding &amp; Cobain, 2011), and as political entities use social media to recruit (Bleiberg &amp; West, 2014) or to further incite conflict (Finighan, 2014).It’s an understatement to say that treating social media as a cure-all without any side effects is dangerous; governmental and non-governmental institutions alike must be sure to consider the potential repercussions. For instance, a recent study found that social media could cause desensitization rather than motivation during times of increased violence (“Drug war violence in Mexico connected with desensitization in social media,” 2014). Inasmuch as social media can be used to combat terrorism, it can also be used to promote terrorism (Hui, 2010). Finally, social media is a double-edged sword that can be wielded by and against the enemy(Kirchner, 2014).“Arab Spring”The West has dubbed the revolutions of the MENA region the “Arab Spring,” which might suggest that the movement is primarily focused on a democratic transition or “democratic blooming,” but Maytha Alhassen, one of the editors of Demanding Dignity: Young Voices from the Front Lines of the Arab Revolutions pointed out in this post that “what is going on in the MENA is something deeper than a democratic transformation, it is what democracy is predicated on—a demand for recognizing the right to human dignity.” Further to this point, the editors of Demanding Dignity: Young Voices from the Front Lines of the Arab Revolutions noted: “as we began to solicit essays from high-profile figures and grassroots activists, we discovered that our call for stories for a book on the ‘Arab Spring’ fell on deaf ears” (Alhassen &amp; Shihab-Eldin, 2012, p. 4282). They found that the terms uprisings, Arab awakening, revolutions, and revolutionary movements were most prevalent, but “the unifying theme across all these revolutions was karama, dignity” (Alhassen &amp; Shihab-Eldin, 2012, p. 4292).In an attempt to better align with the focus and intent of those participating in the movements in the Middle East and North Africa, future posts will primarily refer to the regional events of this project as the Arab uprisings.Next Up: Tunisia's BackgroundReferences  The Arab Spring country by country.

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Tunisia's Background",
        "excerpt":"What triggered the movements in Tunisia?Mohamed Bouazizi’s self immolation in late 2010 may have been the spark that ignited the Tunisian uprisings that would overthrow Ben Ali in January of 2011, but the country’s history of corruption, repression, and censorship combined with increased economic disparity made it into a tinderbox.CorruptionTunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, and Habib Bourguiba became the country’s first leader. As such, he and his party worked to liberalize the nation. Women’s and minority rights, public access to education, and constitutional reform were attained very early on. Despite what appeared to be a promising start, Bourguiba had a penchant for control; he slowly and strategically took command over the media, labor organizations, and political parties and movements by establishing himself as the “maker and breaker of political careers” (Alexander, 2013, pp. 953-956) through the use of incentives to those who were loyal and the repression of dissidents.Corruption reigned under both Bourguiba and Ben Ali’s rule, but up until the 1980s, Tunisians generally tolerated this repressive institution in exchange for relative security from economic hardship. When economic growth and stability disappeared in the 1980s, the regime could no longer buy Tunisian support for their corrupt and increasingly greedy practices. Ben Ali ousted Bourguiba in 1986, inheriting a broken political system and an increasingly severe economic crisis. Like his predecessor, Ben Ali was able to use internal divisions to his advantage, maintaining control of the regime through a dispositif de quadrillage, or “control grid” (Marzouki, 2013, p. 533) based on repression and fear.RepressionBourguiba discretely secured his position of power through the division of opposing political parties and the manipulation of individuals striving to gain or maintain his favor. Ben Ali, however, relied heavily on violence to repress Tunisian dissent as raids, house inspections, and torture become increasingly commonplace. In 2007, Human Rights Watch reported that “the government uses the threat of terrorism and religious extremism as a pretext to crack down on peaceful dissent” (Kallander, 2013, p. 830).In contrast to other countries in the region, both Bourguiba and Ben Ali marginalized military forces in the management of Tunisia and intentionally underfunded and understaffed it. Concurrently, Tunisia became one of the most heavily policed states in the world. By 2002, the police and intelligence forces were estimated to have over 100,000 members in a country of approximately 10 million people. Police forces were the channel through which Tunisians connected to state services, but they also functioned as the main surveillance structure for the country.CensorshipOther aggressive tactics were employed alongside physical violence in an attempt to silence the voice of dissent. Citizens knew that the state-run media was a mechanism for propaganda; newspapers were owned by members of Ben Ali’s family, and the government wrote most content for radio and television. As a result, dissatisfied Tunisians relied heavily on the Internet for information. This too was censored by the regime. Users trying to access social media sites, blogs, or other sites the government associated with dissidence would instead see a “404 Not Found” error. This earned the nation a place on Reporters Without Borders’ list of “Internet Enemies” (Kallander, 2013, p. 781).Economic disparityOver time, Tunisia became increasingly indebted to foreign lenders who offered financial assistance in exchange for adherence to the neoliberal policies set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These economic reforms began under Bourguiba and continued under Ben Ali. Privatization and globalization of the national economy were prescribed by the IMF, and Ben Ali embraced these policies as he, his family, and his loyal subjects positioned themselves to reap the benefits of the new structure.The foreign lenders’ structural adjustment plan emphasized the need for reduced state spending, so public investments in health care, education, and pensions were cut. IMF and World Bank-backed transfers of land out of the hands of small farmers and into the hands of large landholders took place between 1986 and 1996, and Tunisia shifted from being a net agricultural exporter to a net importer (Ciezadlo, 2011, p. 3455). Despite the theoretical justifications of a structural adjustment program based on “trickle-down” economics, no net job creation resulted, and Tunisia’s poor became poorer and less secure (King, 2013, pp. 1066-1163). The editors of The Arab Revolts summarized the results of these policies:  “The uneven development of the last four decades has exacerbated historical tensions and disparities between urban and rural Tunisians. What investment was earmarked for rural projects-millions in loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, among other sources-ultimately profited the agrarian elites who formed the backbone of Tunisia’s post-colonial ruling class” (McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 424).When state subsidies on food staples were removed in 1984 the people rioted against the government. These bread riots were an indication of the increased dissatisfaction with the government that was to come.The middle class deteriorated, and the country’s un- and underemployment rates spiked. Those hardest hit were citizens holding university degrees; 46% were without jobs commensurate with their educations (Marzouki, 2013, p. 548).Despite all of this, in 2008 the West dubbed the economic reform in Tunisia a success and even a “good example for emerging countries”(Marzouki, 2013, p. 520).How was the revolution accomplished?The world reacted with surprise when it became clear that Tunisia had initiated an uprising that would quickly spread across the MENA region. In retrospect, it is much clearer that Tunisian’s experience organizing movements and sidestepping censorship tools helped enable them to unite as one people, intent upon overthrowing the regime.Al-sha‘b al-tunisiDuring the bread riots of 1983-1984, the regime referred to “the people” primarily in a patronizing fashion (Marzouki, 2013, p. 633). Western media were quick to conclude that the riots after Bouazizi’s self immolation were another bread riot, and the people of Tunisia responded to this with the slogan ash-shab yurid isqat an-nizam, or “the people want the fall of the regime” (Marzouki, 2013, p. 626). In the time leading up to the uprising of 2010, the concept of sha‘b, or “the people” grew to represent the ideals of a more united and pluralistic society. Sha’b, in comparison to the state, communicated a message of inclusivity and of dignity.Organized movementsTunisia’s history of collective action despite the repression of Bouagigi and Ben Ali’s regimes plays an integral role in the eventual removal of a well-established regime. In 2008, protests exploded in the western town of Resdayef and then spread to neighboring towns in the region. Even with a media blackout, news of the riots spread beyond Tunisia’s borders and inspired acts of solidarity online and in cities throughout the country (Chomiak &amp; Entelis, 2013, p. 1292).Mine workers were on strike for several months before being overcome by the military (McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 453). In May of 2010, Tunisie en Blanc (Tunisia in White)—a peaceful demonstration against Internet censorship—was organized via Facebook and Twitter and called for people to “dress in white and have coffee on the avenue” (Chomiak &amp; Entelis, 2013, pp. 1299-1301). Though individually unsuccessful, movements such as these are credited as being a foundation upon which the 2010 riots could eventually succeed. The people had begun to rediscover their voice.Social mediaThe use of social media in the Tunisian uprisings was aided by the fact that the country has one of the highest rates of Internet and mobile phone penetration in the region. The revolt in Tunisia came to be referred to as the first “Twitter revolution,” as citizens documented the regime’s violence, disseminated that information, and then coordinated protests through the network. Union workers went on strike, and over two million Tunisians changed their Facebook profiles to say, “Ben Ali dégage!” or “Ben Ali, leave!” (Chomiak &amp; Entelis, 2013, p. 1266) and Al Jazeera covered the revolts and developed a program to allow mobile phones to collect to its satellite. Anonymous’ “Operation Tunisia” took down Ben Ali’s website as well as other government sites. The ability with which citizens united and coordinated their message was undoubtedly facilitated by social media tools, but the experience gained from organized movements of the past was imperative to their efficacy.January 2011The people of Tunisia found their voice, and with it they made their message clear: they demanded the removal of the regime, freedom from oppression and corruption, and dignity. But Ben Ali still failed to understand their message. Showing just how out-of-touch he was with his subjects, he offered to stop censoring sites like YouTube in an attempt to placate protestors on January 13th (Marzouki, 2013, p. 604). On January 14th, after the military turned against him, refusing to fire on protestors, Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia.Why this mattersThose who wish to oppress others do so by instilling fear—of terrorism, the “other”, or the regime itself—and by promoting division among the “rank and file.” Tunisia’s history provides us with a rich example of the power that finding common ground or a cause to unite behind can wield. We are increasingly interconnected through the use of technology (like social media) and should use it to learn from and support each other. Finally, “one-size-fits-all” development tactics are unlikely to succeed. Privatization and globalization of markets may help an economy legitimately thrive where inclusive institutions exist, but they’re likely to promote corruption and increase the gap between the rich and the poor if extractive institutions exist. Take a look at this blog post for more on that subject.Next Up: Egypt's BackgroundReferences  McMurray, D., &amp; Ufheil-Somers, A. (2013).

        "excerpt":"What triggered the movements in Egypt?The MENA region was watching as Tunisians ousted their autocratic regime. Egyptians undoubtedly saw similarities in their own situation—a repressive, corrupt regime and growing economic disparity. Ben Ali fled Tunisia on January 14, 2011; soon after, Egypt’s initial call to arms was set for January 25th.CorruptionAn Egyptian intellectual coined the term julukiyya to describe a monarchy (malakiyya) disguised by outward displays of republicanism (jumhuriyya) (McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 214). The term has been used to describe Mubarak’s Egypt. Presidential elections were a one-party referendum up until 2005, and many suspected that Hosni Mubarak was grooming his son, Gamal, to succeed him. He had already been put in government and party roles related to furthering the neoliberalization of the economy; resultant private-sector developments helped the Mubaraks amass billions of dollars in personal wealth.Mubarak and the National Democratic Party (NDP) entertained appeals for democracy through the careful control of political parties and elections as well as other civic organizations, “providing space for just enough participatory politics to keep people busy without threatening regime dominance” (El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1611) and, unlike in Tunisia, the media was relatively free. Mubarak didn’t try to suppress dissent so much as manage it. He relied upon the state police forces to promote fear, distrust, and disunity. Additionally, rather than acting on behalf of workers, the Egyptian Trade Union Federation was used as a state-sanctioned means of control over them.The military—or “Military Inc.” (Marshall &amp; Stacher, 2013, pp. 2879-2886)—has historically had its own political and economic priorities. For instance, the army controls industries ranging from the production of olive oil to voting booths. Since military holdings and spending are considered to be state secrets, no one knows exactly how much of Egypt’s economy the military controls. It is known, however, that the army “oversees numerous subsidiaries of state-owned holding companies and owns shares in public-private ventures. In many cases, these smaller operations are embedded in transnational conglomerates that reach into several economic sectors, from construction and maritime shipping to weapons manufacturing” (Marshall &amp; Stacher, 2013, p. 2887).Economic disparityLike Tunisia, Egypt also became indebted to foreign lenders and was subject to structural adjustment plans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Funds for public services were cut and privatization plans were initiated under President Sadat and then expanded upon under Mubarak. Land was consolidated into large tracts for industrial agriculture and real estate development and managed by private corporations or wealthy families. In the 1980s, the World Bank led infrastructure-building efforts for tourist development using public funds and then routed profits from it into privately controlled outside entities in the 1990s. One young man’s assessment of working in the tourist development was that “life was a meal you never got to eat” (Mitchell, 2013, p. 2064).Prices rose and wages remained the same or declined. In 2008, there were shortages of bread at the subsidized cost, and bread in private bakeries cost 5 times as much. This was unaffordable to some 40 percent of the population living on less than $2 per day and resulted in riots.Egypt had a large percentage of youth—two thirds of the population were under the age of 30, and unemployment rates were 10 times greater for college graduates than those without a degree (Castells, 2013, p. 1044). Underemployment was another concern. In 2010, estimates suggested that 3 million Egyptians had been hired as temp workers with monthly salaries around 100 Egyptian pounds per month (about $13), without health benefits, and under terms that gave employers the right to fire them without reason or warning. The government’s increase of the monthly minimum wage to 400 Egyptian pounds (about $52) didn’t apply to any of the 7 million people working in the informal economy.RepressionThe impunity of Mubarak’s police force became well known over the course of his three decades in power. El Ghobashyi noted:  The coercive apparatus had become the chief administrative arm of the state, aggregating the functions of several agencies. Police not only dealt with crime and issued passports, drivers’ licenses, and birth and death certificates. They also resolved local conflicts over land and sectarian relations; fixed all national and sub-national elections; vetted graduate school candidates and academic appointments at every level; monitored shop floors and mediated worker-management conflicts; observed soccer games and Friday prayers; and maintained a network of local informants in poor neighborhoods, to ensure that dispossession was not converted into political organization (2013, p. 1676).Anti-terrorism laws were used to justify attacks on Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Reports of torture became so commonplace that the regime didn’t bother denying them. Egyptians were pushed to the brink in 2010 when word spread that police had dragged a young man, Khalid Sa’id, out of an Internet cafe and then beaten him to death. It was alleged to be petty drug arrest, but Sa’id had recently shared a video exposing police corruption.How was the revolution accomplished?By the time Tunisia’s regime fell, Egyptians were ready to take on their own government. Appropriately enough, January 25th was a bank holiday designated “Police Day,” so the date was set.Social mediaSocial media was used heavily in the days leading up to January 25th. The organization that started a “We Are All Khalid Sa‘id” Facebook page and staged protests against police brutality and human rights abuses in 2010 was also a significant player in the demonstrations against the government on January 25, 2011. Videos sharing scenes of police brutality were used to call Egyptians to join them in the street. Protest groups from many different backgrounds—worker’s unions, actors, soccer fans, Khalid Sa’id’s mother—confirmed their participation and urged others to join them in opposition to the regime (El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1712).The April 6 Youth Movement was formed in solidarity with textile workers in 2008 and had a following of over 70,000 people on Facebook. One of its founders, Asmaa Mafhouz, posted a video on Facebook on January 18th calling Egyptians to action:  We are going to Tahrir on January 25th … If you stay home, you deserve all that’s being done to you, and you will be guilty before your nation and your people. Go down to the street, send SMSs, post it on the Net, make people aware.The video went viral, leading it to be referred to as “The Vlog that Helped Spark the Revolution” (Castells, 2013, p. 877).On January 27th, the government shut down Internet and cellular phone service in an attempt to keep protestors from communicating with each other. The reaction this elicited was apparently unexpected by the police, but as Sadek noted:  Even if I were an apathetic young person who could not care less about the political protests, if you took away something vital to my daily life I would go out and protest against that. Many people joined the protests that day only because when Internet and phones were cut off they could not find out what was going on any other way. And once they felt the power of freedom even for a minute, they could not go back (Sadek, 2012, p. 1132).Activists across the globe also pooled resources to help connect Egyptians to each other in the same way they had for Tunisians.Organized movementsMubarak’s security forces maintained control by promoting fragmentation and distrust between interest groups. Even well-organized movements with large followings like that of the April 6 Youth were effectively suppressed when they went up against the regime by themselves. In 2009, a political scientist with allegiance to Mubarak illustrated how confident the regime was in its control, saying “widespread, politically motivated unrest was unlikely because it was not part of the ‘Egyptian mentality’”(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1653).Despite the government’s success record against protests, the 2000s were a decade of increased incidents of collective action, and it took place in the street. Between 2004 and 2008, over 2,000 strikes consisting of 1.5 million Egyptian workers were held. They demanded increases in pay and fair working conditions. Between 2004 and 2011, middle class activist groups and professional associations organized rallies and protests against the continued use of emergency laws and the repression of journalists. Political demonstrations united student, Islamist, labor, and professional groups. Even the fan networks of Egyptian soccer teams had a history of demonstrations against the police. The obviously rigged results of the national legislative elections at the end of 2010 also enraged citizens and political elites to protest in December 2010 (El Ghobashyi, 2013, pp. 1698-1703) and contributed to the unification that occurred on January 25th.By January 2011, organizers had seasoned tactics for combatting Mubarak’s security forces. They started by publicly announcing a false time and location for January 25th’s demonstrations and then disseminating actual plans by phone so that they could gather large crowds on their way through side streets and then overwhelm security forces as they encountered them (El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1749). In the days that followed, additional groups such as the Nasserists and the Muslim Brothers joined the protests. On Friday, January 28th, the masses surrounded the institutions they associated with Mubarak’s regime—police stations, government buildings, and NDP headquarters—and demanded their removal.The mobilization and unification of vastly different interest groups—industrial and farm laborers, civil and professional workers, students, religious, political, and social organizations—behind a single message caught the regime off guard and led to the eventual removal of Mubarak. El Ghobashyi asserts, “The genius of the Egyptian revolution was its methodical restoration of the public weal. The uprising restored the meaning of politics, if by that term is understood the making of collective claims on government. It revalued the people, revealing them in all their complexity-neither heroes nor saints, but citizens” (El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1981).February 2011A regime accustomed to serially addressing disparate protest groups was unable to withstand Egyptians’ united front. The people rejected the economic policies that had steadily increased the gap between rich and poor for decades. They rejected pervasive corruption and repression and embraced the hope for reform that Tunisia’s uprising had instilled within them, and they effectively utilized social media to organize and disseminate their message. When the military refused to fire on protestors and removed their support from the regime, Hosni Mubarek had little choice but to resign; he did so on February 11, 2011. After witnessing what happened in Egypt, the people of the MENA region began to rise up in demand of dignity and in opposition to their own repressive and corrupt regimes.Why this mattersIn Demanding Dignity, Dina Sadek recounts a scene she witnessed as she stood in Tahrir Square:  I am never going to forget the face of an older man in his sixties who was standing in the square. He was checking on a young man who had a bandage on his head due to being injured by a stone. The old man cried and apologized to the young protester, “I am sorry, I am really sorry you have to go through this now. If only my generation had been brave enough to do this a long time ago, you wouldn’t have to go through this now (Sadek, 2012, p. 1090).Ben Ali and Mubarak aren’t the first leaders to blatantly abuse human rights and betray their constituents. Such atrocities often build gradually and systematically rather than appearing suddenly. Though it isn’t a guaranteed deterrent against autocracy, we all can and should be vigilant against the diminishment of human rights.With each technological advancement, we become more interconnected. This makes it easier to witness and react to crimes against humanity throughout the world. It also means that it’s easier to become overwhelmed and desensitized, but if we aren’t brave enough to stand up to those who violate our rights as humans now, we’re setting future generations up for an even greater struggle. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best in his letter from Birmingham jail: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”Next Up: Libya's BackgroundReferences  McMurray, D., &amp; Ufheil-Somers, A. (2013).

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Libya's Background",
        "excerpt":"What triggered the movements in Libya?The background of Libya’s uprising is both simpler and more difficult to cover. It’s simple in that its history as an independent nation is fairly short—the country was established in 1952 after Italian colonialism and World War II ended. It had only had two rulers—King Idris and Colonel Mu’ammar Gaddafi. It’s more difficult to cover because information on life within Libya’s borders in the 40-some years prior to the uprising in 2011 is more sparse and suspect of being tightly controlled the regime.Libya suffered greatly under Italy’s colonial rule and during World War II when it was the site of large land warfare campaigns between Axis and Ally troops. The region at that time consisted of three independent territories, which were eventually consolidated and led first by King Idris. King Idris was overthrown by the Free Unionist Officers on September 1, 1969. Gaddafi took power as chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council on January 16, 1970.VolatilityGaddafi’s rule consisted of unpredictable extremes. Libyans experienced internal and external power struggles in the 1970s and were outcasts in the 1980s due to ties to acts of terrorism such as the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. International perceptions of the country improved in the 1990s. Through it all, “Gaddafi was always plotting…he was always one to cultivate allies. If, and/or when, they chose against him, he quickly dispensed with them and sought new allies” (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 14). In the early 2000s, Gaddafi even took part in the signing of the constitution for the African Union, which focused on the protection of human rights, promotion of democracy, defense of sovereignty, independence of member states, and the promotion of peace, security, and stability.The government supported the broadening of cultural, educational, economic, and women’s rights in Libya and simultaneously provided arms to terrorist organizations throughout the world. All the while, Gaddafi insisted upon the speaking of Arabic and maintained strict control of the Internet, media, education, and public relations, which effectively isolated the country from the rest of the world (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 129). Lobban summed this up, saying “If ever there was a schizophrenic nation, it was Libya under Gaddafi. His commitment to good was outweighed by his destructive tendencies” (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 76).CorruptionColonel Gaddafi is probably most well-known for his Green Book. Of its three tenets, two prescribed solutions to the problems of democracy and the economy. His economic solutions were socialistic. For instance, he eliminated wage systems in exchange for a partnership or income sharing structure, citizens were permitted to own their homes but nothing else, land was not to be considered private property. Thanks to the country’s oil wealth, the regime did improve public services and standards of living such that they lived far above most other averages in the region—per capita GDP in Libya was estimated at $8,400 in 2005, compared to Egypt’s at $4,400 and Tunisia’s at $7,600. The regime also utilized oil wealth for development projects such as the Great Manmade River project.Contrary to the prescribed solution in his Green Book, though, Gaddafi, his family and cronies accumulated great quantities of land and money. Gaddafi’s sons were notorious for their spending habits and irresponsibility (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 130). He and his family controlled all media and communication outlets—”He shuts down cellular phone and Internet services at the flick of a switch” (Pelham, 2011). Militiamen held real estate and farmland as well as power over ports and banks.RepressionGaddafi’s fear over being overthrown led him to intentionally weaken his armed forces by limiting their training and education:  Possibly realizing that his own hold was as fragile as that of King Idris, he stopped planning for the future and began to plan for the here and now. That required dispensing with adversaries or untrustworthy subordinates. That also required ensuring that while technically sophisticated, his armed forces weren’t so well integrated that they could coherently form against him and overturn his regime (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 83).As a result, militiamen were not centralized or tactical fighters, and they maintained loyalties to their respective tribes and regions. This severely crippled his defenses against rebels in 2011, as many defected under pressure. Gaddafi’s troops had significantly better weaponry, but the rebel force’s popular support was steadily growing. Additionally, his extensive stockpiles of weapons were turned against him when they fell into the hands of rebels and Islamists.Gaddafi was known to celebrate those who supported him and publicly hang those who opposed him. The use of fear, repression, and special intelligence forces were common tools implemented to maintain order. Human Rights Watch alleges that 1,270 prisoners—Islamists, political rivals or otherwise—were killed when they attempted to either escape or revolt in June of 1996 (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 69).How was the revolution accomplished?Tunisia and Egypt’s successful revolutions undoubtedly motivated the uprisings in Libya, but the unification—albeit brief—of Libyans and the assistance of the international community helped ensure that Gaddafi was permanently removed from rule.UnificationThe Libyan population is spread across a vast area—it’s the fourth largest country in Africa, with an area slightly larger than the state of Alaska. Access to the interior of the country was highly dependent on travel by airplane. Gaddafi had used this to his advantage for over 40 years, so the unification of Libyans against Gaddafi’s forces was a significant feat in the 2011 uprisings. Though communications were severely controlled and access to technology was significantly more limited than in other countries, rebels reported using the Internet to coordinate protest efforts. The ability to see each other’s successes as well as Gaddafi’s atrocities has been attributed with propelling the movement forward at a rate that caught Gaddafi’s forces off guard.The arrest of a human rights lawyer, Fathi Terbil, is likely to have sparked protests in Benghazi, a city with a history of revolt against past oppressors, on February 15th, just days after Mubarak fell in Egypt. By the 17th, The Day of Revolt, protests had spread to other cities. When military forces fired on protestors, they responded with even greater force, burning government buildings and police stations. On the 20th, rebels took control of Benghazi. This got Gaddafi’s attention, and he sent jets to bomb Benghazi on February 21.By the end of February, Libyans in Benghazi had formed the National Transitional Congress (NTC) and renounced Gaddafi, but Tripoli was still subject to his rule. This effectively divided the country between east and west, but the rebels continued to raid military garrisons and gather arms. In response, Gaddafi threatened that “inch by inch, room by room, house by house, alley by alley,” he would eliminate the “rats” and “cockroaches” without mercy. The severity of this language encouraged French President Nicolas Sarkozy to push for action against Gaddafi (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, p. 132).On March 5th, the NTC declared itself the “only legitimate body representing the people of Libya and the Libyan state” (“Battle for Libya: Key moments,” 2011). Gaddafi’s army set out toward Benghazi, intent upon crushing the resistance. The NTC’s forces deteriorated quickly under this assault, and they appealed to the international community for help.International interventionThe importance of the Libyan people’s united opposition to their authoritarian regime should not be downplayed. However, if the Arab League had not endorsed the use of air strikes by NATO and other allies, it’s quite likely that results of Libya’s uprising would have been much different. On March 17th, the UN Security Council passed resolution 1973, which authorized member states to take action to protect Libyan civilians. Patience for Gaddafi’s political unpredictability, corruption, and brutality had run out. The African Union, Arab League, neighboring states, and Libyans were tired of his unreliable promises and alliances. As Lobban notes, “This was all business. The business of getting rid of a ruler whose time had passed; whose influence had diminished and turned against his own people; whose interests lay in the retention of power for the sake of, rather than the practice of good stewardship, that differentiates good leaders from despots” (Lobban &amp; Dalton, 2014, pp. 77-78).On March 19, NATO began bombing campaigns led initially by the French. These campaigns effectively crippled Gaddafi’s forces and weakened supply lines. Tripoli was surrounded by NTC forces on August 16th and on August 21st Operation Mermaid Dawn is reported to have rallied all rebel troops from the west against Gaddafi in what would be his final stand. In September, the NTC’s leaders arrived in Tripoli and began their attempts to build a new government.October 2011On October 20th, Gaddafi’s hometown of Sirte was captured, and the NTC confirmed that Gaddafi had died from battle wounds. However, mobile phone videos captured his death at the hands of rebel fighters. Mustafa Abdel Jalil, the leader of the NTC declared the liberation of Libya on October 23rd. Gaddafi and his son, Mutassim, were buried in an undisclosed location in the desert on October 25th.Why this mattersLibya’s background has some similarities to that of Tunisia and Egypt, but the most significant difference can be seen in Libyans’ egregious use of violence to combat the regime. The overthrow of Gaddafi took eight months to accomplish and cost thousands of lives. Conflicts between rebel groups during the uprising led media sources to refer to it as a civil war rather than a revolution. It would be naive to suggest that Libyans could have succeeded in overthrowing a leader known for his brutal tactics without using some degree of violence themselves. It could, however, be debated that the repercussions of using such violent means to accomplish an end will resonate within the country far longer than anyone bargained for—violence begets violence.It is also noteworthy that, of the three countries being reviewed for this project, Libya is the only one in which an outside entity intervened. What caused the international community to respond here and not in Egypt or Tunisia? It’s possible that Libya’s role as one of the world’s leading oil producers is a contributing factor. 70-80% is exported to European countries, and the United States also resumed imports of Libyan oil in 2004. European countries across the Mediterranean Sea also risked seeing increased volumes of refugees as a result of the conflict. What other factors do you think could have contributed to the UN and NATO’s decision?

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Social Media in Tunisia",
        "excerpt":"The Arab uprising’s accomplishments throughout the MENA region are often attributed to the use of social media. In comparison, social media was recognized as one of several common components in analysts’ assessments of Tunisia.YouthYouth initiated the uprisings when they circulated a video of Bouazizi setting himself on fire. The calls to action online were reinforced and expanded in the streets by civil and political organizations. Though no one could have predicted what would trigger the outrage of the nation, protests were described by analysts as intentional, organized events. Tunisian cyber activists had established connections with international activist groups like Anonymous to combat censorship in the years prior to the 2010 revolution (Honwana, 2013, p. 50).\t\tHamada Ben­-Amor, or el général, helped mobilize many Tunisian youth against the regime.Technology proliferation“Three months before Mohammed Bouazizi burned himself in Sidi Bouzid we had a similar case in Monastir. But no one knew about it because it was not filmed. What made a difference this time is that the images of Bouazizi were put on Facebook and everybody saw it” (Beaumont, 2011)Access to the Internet in Tunisia was very high for the region—in 2009, the number of Tunisians using the Internet was around 2.8 million out of 5.4 million citizens. Of the 2.8 million online, 2.5 million of users had Facebook accounts, and 42% of them were between ages 18-24 (Honwana, 2013, pp. 58-59).Tunisian bloggers and cyber activists were important actors in the uprising, functioning as mediators between the people and official media, which was done at great risk to their safety (Sarnelli, 2013, p. 159). As blogs and other social media were censored with greater frequency, Facebook (which was not blocked) became the primary resource for dissidents. Twitter was valuable, but only to a very small subset of the population; there were about 200 active users on Twitter prior to the Tunisian uprisings and a few thousand once it got started (Beaumont, 2011).A common opinion is that social media changed the methods through which citizens could fight for democracy. In defense of this stance, Howard asserted that “the countries with the lowest levels of technology proliferation have also tended to have the weakest democratization movements” and went on to emphasize that “digital media has allowed people to unite around shared grievances and build local responses to them. They were not inspired by Facebook; they were inspired by the real tragedies documented on Facebook” (Howard &amp; Hussain, 2011, pp. 47-48).Al JazeeraAl Jazeera was the first major news organization on the scene, and their decision to air the Tunisian protests is believed to have played a critical role in the uprising’s success. Wadah Khanfar, head of Al Jazeera, spoke of the media company’s role in the movement just months after it occurred: “Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [it]. We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world—and internationally, globally, through our English channel” (2011).The most significant of Al Jazeera English’s contributions was that it connected the English-speaking international community to Tunisian protestors, promoting interrelationships between established and new media channels. Additionally, the language used to describe events gave the movement validity as it shifted from a “protest” to “political unrest” or “uprising” and then to “revolution” on January 19th (Sarnelli, 2013, pp. 164-172).Culture“The founders of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube did not create their products with the intent of starting revolutions and ousting dictators, and though they may feel they have played a role in the process by providing these vehicles for change, these revolutions begin in the minds and imaginations of those driving them. They choose their tools and their mediums for communication, whether it is print, radio, blogging or just word of mouth, but the strength of a movement lies ultimately in the will for activism” (Storck, 2011).A number of analysts criticized the fact that many Western commentators were preoccupied with the wrong details of the revolution. They emphasized that communication technologies should not be blindly equated with democracy—how technology is used depends on who is using it and what their intentions are. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the entire media environment and culture that the technology is a part of (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1282). For example, Graziano notes that the Tunisian diaspora “acted as the main driving force that shaped Tunisian activism on the Web” by inspiring the dissidence of Tunisians still living in the country with their accounts of life out from under Ben Ali’s rule (Graziano, 2012, p. 541).Why this mattersIn the same way that some educators refuse to regard Wikipedia as a valid source of academic information, mass media and its audience have long regarded bloggers and social media users as anything but journalists. That’s a complex argument to get into here, but I think this much can be acknowledged: Al Jazeera English bridged the gap between different media platforms and formats with their reporting in Tunisia. Doing so consequently gave those citizen journalists who had only ever published information via social media some credibility for their work. This has inspired new waves of citizen journalists, which will—for better and for worse—contribute a bit more color to the broad palette of our collective existence.The same can be said about the naiveté, the passion, and the power of our youth. They are versatile, they are bold, and they are more aware than we often give them credit for. This isn’t means for concern as long as we’re not oppressing them.Next Up: Analyses of Social Media's Role in EgyptReferences  Honwana, A. (2013). Youth and Revolution in Tunisia. Zed.

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Social Media in Egypt",
        "excerpt":"Many analysts have spoken confidently about the positive role that social media played in the Egyptian revolution of 2011, but potentially negative aspects of the relationship were addressed, as well. We’ll cover several common points in this post.BlogsEgypt’s policies for online content were considerably less restrictive than Tunisia’s. Prior to the protests in early 2011, Egypt didn’t formally censor websites or content. Instead, Mubarak’s security forces monitored communications and then harassed and imprisoned activists—a different approach to censorship than that employed by Ben Ali’s regime. Despite this, a lively community of users and political bloggers blossomed starting around 2005. This allowed Egyptians to increase political awareness, communicate with other activists, and freely spread ideas of hope and change (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, pp. 1277-1282).Social networking“Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that, ‘Wow, I’m not alone. There are a lot of people who are frustrated’” (Ghonim, 2011).About 17% of Egypt’s population were connected to the Internet at home; even more connected in Internet cafes. Facebook was the most popular social networking site, with almost 5 million users—approximately 22% of all Facebook users in the region (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1277). Its role in the mobilization of protestors for the riots on April 6, 2008 signaled a shift toward social networking rather than blogging (Sarnelli, 2013, p. 160).Facebook and Twitter were used to announce the details of demonstrations and spread images of the regime’s corruption as well as its abuse of Egyptians. Twitter was identified as a crucial enough resource for protestors that Mubarak’s regime ordered mobile service providers to send out notifications like those sent by Twitter to rally his own supporters (Beaumont, 2011).Facebook pages like We are all Khaled Said and the April 6 Youth Movement were increasingly used as resources for seeking and sharing knowledge among activists, both inside and out of Egypt. Within 6 weeks of the start of protests on January 25th, 357,000 followers on the We are all Khaled Said Facebook page had grown to 1,026,000. Srinivasan asserted that this is what social media did best: it interconnected the local and the global; it helped protesters think and communicate across rather than simply within networks (Srinivasan, 2012).Rinke and Röder note, however, that “the spillover from the virtual spaces to the Egyptian streets would not have been possible without other communication technologies, such as mobile phones, e-mail, and satellite television channels” (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1278). At 72%, Egyptians’ access to mobile phones was over four times greater than their access to the Internet (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1278). Text messages and emails were used to pass sensitive information along within trusted, personal networks rather than via broad online networks like Facebook.When Mubarak’s regime shut down Internet and mobile phone networks, Egyptians found other ways to get their message out. For instance, an American student with friends in Egypt created a Twitter account called Jan25voices, which he used to publish messages his friends relayed to him by phone (Sarnelli, 2013, p. 166).Al JazeeraTelevisions were said to be in every living room, coffee shop, store, and waiting room in Egypt. This afforded media outlets a distinct opportunity in the Egyptian revolutions. Contradictions between the state-run channels’ coverage of protests and that of transnational stations such as Al Jazeera were laid bare.Al Jazeera played a similar role in Egypt to that in Tunisia, positioning itself as a facilitator of two-way communication between protestors and the international public (Sarnelli, 2013, p. 171). Its broadcast of the protests started the day after the January 25th demonstrations, at which point it provided live broadcasting of the uprisings until Mubarak left office.The network established connections between countries in the region via its Arabic channels and outside of the region in English. Rinke and Röder emphasize the significance of this:  Arabs do not have to overcome a language barrier to a transnational public sphere, which likely was a significant factor leading to the popular spread of protest across country borders to Libya, Bahrain, and Syria, to name just the most visible examples…transnational news channels in the Arab region can be an important relay station for disseminating the idea of anti-authoritarian protest und renewing the idea of pan-Arabism in the struggle for freedom (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1280).Newer and older media converged when Al Jazeera reporters started collecting ideas for stories from Twitter. “This creates possibilities of things to move across cultural groups and make bridges between people across different segments of a population” (Srinivasan, 2012).CultureRinke and Röder point out that oral communication was a critical component of the uprisings. One-to-one communication promoted the trust necessary to mobilize a greater number of people (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, p. 1275). This was best exemplified in its use during Friday Mosque, where citizens congregated after prayers to discuss political issues. On Friday, January 28th, Internet and mobile phone networks had been shut down. Egyptians gathered after prayers to protest the regime, calling it a Day of Anger.Egypt’s revolution drew generations of different socio-economic backgrounds and ideologies together. Wael Ghonim spoke to this:  Who would [have] imagined before the 25th, if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them, and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them—this is amazing. All the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media, are proven wrong. This whole revolution showed us how ugly such a regime was and how great and amazing the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman, how simple and amazing these people are whenever they have a dream (Ghonim, 2011).Double-edged swordSocial media has been presented as a potent weapon against authoritarian regimes, but Morozov warned that it has also been effectively used by governments to monitor and suppress citizens. For instance, in Egypt, it was discovered that Mubarak’s regime had been testing a tool developed by a Western company that allowed them to eavesdrop on Skype conversations, which were thought to be immune from wiretapping. This, Morozov said, isn’t uncommon. The Egyptian government also used Internet traffic surveillance tools sold by Narus, a company owned by Boeing (Morozov, 2011). “Left uncontrolled, Western surveillance tools could undermine the Internet freedom agenda in the same way arms exports undermine Western-led peace initiatives” (Morozov, 2011).Rinke and Röder added that, rather than shutting down online forums, the Egyptian regime’s supporters interfered with discussions by spreading rumors meant to increase confusion and anxiety; text messages were sent to Egyptian mobile phones when the networks were disabled for public use, warning of pillagings and encouraging recipients to stay home and protect their families and property (Rinke &amp; Röder, 2011, pp. 1281-1282). Srinivasan also warned of the danger of echo chambers—if you surround yourself with only those who share the same ideas as yourself, you risk the likelihood of distorting your perception of reality (Srinivasan, 2012).Fukuyama’s critique of social media’s role in Egypt questioned next steps in institution building:  Facebook, which went public last week, has been credited with helping to build democracy internationally. It is true that it and other social media have democratized access to information, and have made collaboration easier. These media have also helped promote short-term mobilization of crowds and demonstrators. But networking is not organization-building. For that, we need a different and more durable platform (Fukuyama, 2012).Why this mattersSrinivasan’s warning that social media can create echo chambers and distort our perception of reality is one most can likely relate to. In Egypt, Twitter users were generally more well off, stayed toward the back of the crowd during protests, and tweeted about freedom while those with lower incomes protested the price of food. Neither stance is invalid, but to present only one side as the cause of the revolution would be false.Echo chambers are a legitimate threat, perpetuated by the speed at which messages spread via social media. For example, regardless of your stance on Indiana and Arkansas’ recently passed Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, you’ll most likely concede that echo chambers exist and have distorted the reality of the situation on the ground. Withholding all business from a state hurts the state and its inhabitants, including those within the LGBT community that live and work there. Lumping all of the LGBT community into one indistinguishable mass strips individuals of their humanity, rationalizing and justifying unequal treatment. The end result is that subsets of the same species are driven further and further apart; interactions and communications become harder to maintain. I’ve written about how effective it was for dictators to maintain power by promoting divisions among their citizens. Why should we think that divisions don’t weaken us as a nation?Next Up: Analyses of Social Media's Role in LibyaReferences  Rinke, E. M., &amp; Röder, M. (2011).

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Social Media in Libya",
        "excerpt":"Libya’s uprisings began shortly after Mubarak was overthrown in Egypt. Like Mubarak, Gaddafi shut down Internet and mobile phone networks inside of Libya early on in the conflicts, signaling that he, like Mubarak, was aware of the dangerous potential those resources had if used against him. Analysts considered this approach and offered several common observations about social media’s role in Libya.Double-edged swordMorozov provided examples of ways in which media technology could be used against citizens in Egypt. He also noted that Gaddafi’s vast spying apparatus was known to monitor text messages, emails, and online chats (Morozov, 2011). His regime sent text messages to threaten citizens and warn of the consequences of using social media to encourage protests. And, as was done in Egypt, the Gaddafi regime sent out Twitter-like text notifications in an attempt to rally supporters (Beaumont, 2011). Activists using Facebook to demand Gaddafi’s resignation were arrested (PaPaioannou &amp; Olivos, 2013, p. 100).Media technology also created problems for those attempting to help Libyans. Humanitarian efforts like the Libya Crisis Map found that an overload of information via social media actually made it difficult for them to manage and verify the information they required to deploy aid to areas that were in need (Morris, 2014, p. 9).Social media“Internet conviviality creates unity and has democratising power that can be shared beyond what in the real world would be the traditional barriers of social and economic standing, cultural similarities and national and regional boundaries. But the Libya example has highlighted an even greater observation: that Internet conviviality can be experienced beyond Internet connectedness” (Morris, 2014, pp. 10-11).Leading up to the uprisings of 2011, only 14% of Libyans had access to the Internet. Gaddafi started shutting down Libya’s Internet services on February 18th; they were almost entirely disabled from the beginning of March until the end of the revolution. However, protest movements increased in size and momentum despite Internet and phone network shutdowns. Those who had access to the Internet used it to spread news about conflicts. Those who didn’t would collect video and photos on their mobile phones, and some would then exchange their SIM cards with people at the country’s borders who could upload data on their behalf.International media outlets, members of the Libyan Diaspora, and Libyans within the country all joined together to call for a “Day of Rage” against the regime on Februry 17th, but protests began in Benghazi two days prior to that, and the video footage collected during those events was used to increase awareness and improve the movement’s credibility (Morris, 2014, p. 4).Twitter became a useful, low bandwidth tool inside of the country for sharing news with the outside world in short bursts. Medical needs, contact information, and satellite frequencies were also shared through such channels. One of the largest social media presences during the uprisings was the Libyan Youth Movement (LYM), which was comprised mostly of members of the Libyan diaspora. They used their large following on Twitter to disseminate messages on behalf of Libyans inside of the country.DiasporaThe Libyan diaspora’s role in the Libyan revolution was regarded as highly significant. The Libyan Youth Movement as well as families and friends abroad facilitated communications between Libya and the international community, especially after the Internet and mobile networks were shut down (Morris, 2014, p. 5). Satellite communications, landlines, Skype, and mobile phones were used to pass messages along. These were often encoded in order to avoid detection by Gaddafi’s surveillance teams. Morris noted that “What was unexpected was how these connections would feed back directly to those within Libya, that the activist reports coming from within Libya but censored in Libya could be reported outside of Libya and beamed back in to generate more activism. A complete circle” (Morris, 2014, p. 10).The dedication of diaspora members and citizen journalists inside of Libya played a role that Morris believed could not be overstated (Morris, 2014, p. 10). She argued that, contrary to Malcolm Gladwell’s assertion that social media campaigns lacked structure and hierarchical strength, the complex network of communications developed between entities within and outside of Libya illustrated that a rigid, persistent campaign could be established (Morris, 2014, p. 10).JournalistsInformation coming out of Libya was limited by Gaddafi’s restriction of the Internet and monitoring of phone lines, but social media was still used to report from within, and then mainstream media augmented those messages effectively enough to get international attention and intervention. Morris suggested that the reason why so many Libyans participated in protests was, at least in part, due to what they had seen on satellite television about the uprisings in neighboring countries. Satellite stations like Al Jazeera shared videos and posts culled from social media in their news feeds, which further connected Libyans even if they had no access to the Internet (Morris, 2014, p. 6).When Gaddafi blocked all outsiders from entering the country, citizen journalists stepped in to ensure that the Libyan uprisings were reported. They did this at great personal risk, putting themselves in between three warring groups: Gaddafi’s army, freedom fighters, and allied foreign troops (“Libya’s New Citizen Journalists,” 2011). Alternative and independent media outlets such as Libya Alhurra developed in Benghazi and transmitted footage of conflict via satellite Internet connections (Morris, 2014, pp. 4-5).    Mohammed Nabbous, founder of Libya Alhurra, is one of the most well known citizen journalists in Libya's revolution. He was killed by snipers on March 19, 2011.Morris spoke of the potential impact of such citizen-driven efforts:  Evidence coming from citizen journalists of state inflicted violence does not necessarily lead to international support in the form of military intervention. The unprecedented use of R2P [Responsibility to Protect] in the case of Libya may more closely reflect the international communities sentiments towards the Gaddafi regime itself than any direct empathy with the Libyan people. It is novel nonetheless that the international community found justification for action within the citizen journalist reports coming from Libya; new media reporting of the crisis therefore may have been the final invitation to act (Morris, 2014, p. 8).When eastern Libya was liberated by rebel fighters, international press and mainstream media organizations took over the role that citizen journalists had filled in their absence. Social media continued to be relied upon as a source of information by media channels (Morris, 2014, p. 7).Why this mattersThe speed at which information can be spread is likely to be the greatest strength and weakness of social media. It disseminated information about what was happening inside of Libya across the globe at a rate that Gaddafi, despite all of his sophisticated efforts, could not stop. The rate at which information was disseminated also complicated humanitarian efforts on the ground in Libya, making it more difficult for aid workers to determine where they most needed to deploy their resources.Also of note is the fact that a nearly continuous deficit of reliable access to Internet and mobile networks did not result in an end to the Libyan movement. Protestors still found ways to get messages out of the country, and once that information was out, it was spread by a broad network of allies as well as members of the Libyan diaspora. Social networks—both on and offline—played important roles in Libya’s revolution.Next Up: Social Media in Tunisia TodayReferences  Beaumont, P. (2011).

        "excerpt":"The Arab Social Media Report, issued by the Dubai School of Government, speaks favorably of social media’s current role in the region, noting that it is “already providing the medium for overcoming many of the monumental barriers for re-inventing public service in the Arab world” and that “we are also witnessing a new wave of convergence, with online social media tools merging with smart phone messaging applications” (“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014, pp. 3-4).We’ll look at these statistics for social media use in the region as well as data from the UN, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Freedom House in order to assess the state of social media in Tunisia today.FacebookTunisia has the highest rate of Facebook use of the three countries studied for this project. For Tunisians ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Facebook on January 13, 2011 was at 18.33% (“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015). In May 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 33.94%; by May of 2014, use was up to 42.1%, or 4.6 million people (“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014).  Facebook is an especially common resource for building and maintaining civic and activist communities. The government has arrested people based on their Facebook activity in the past, but there have been no recorded instances of politically-motivated censorship in the past year (“Freedom House | Tunisia,” 2015).TwitterTunisia has the second highest rate of Twitter use of the three countries studied for this project. For Tunisians ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Twitter on September 1, 2011 was at 0.09% (“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015). In March 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 0.31%; by March of 2014, the rate of use was at 0.34%, or 37,100 people (“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014).  Youth and civil organizations have used Twitter to live-tweet sessions of the National Constituent Assembly (“Freedom House | Tunisia,” 2015). In March 2015, Tunisians took to Twitter to criticize inaccurate reports that ISIS had taken over the town of Tataouine, whose name inspired the Star Wars fictional planet (Abrougui, 2015). Though the topic was serious, many used humor to convey their message:  Voici l&#39;émir de Tataouine, un barbu comme vous le voyez pic.twitter.com/JQX11TKrPm&mdash; Hédi (@ayalez_hdi) March 25, 2015    Translation: \"Here is the emir of Tataouine, a bearded man as you see.\"Internet and mobile access ratesIn a previous post, it was noted that Tunisia had one of the highest rates of Internet and mobile phone access in the region. This was thought to have contributed to the success of Tunisia’s uprisings. In the table below, it can be seen that, with the exception of a dip in 2013 mobile rates, Internet use and mobile subscriptions have continued to increase year after year.Table 1. UN/International Telecommunication Union Data            Type      2005      2010      2011      2012      2013                  Internet use 1 (% population)      9.7      36.8      39.1      41.4      43.8              Mobile subscriptions2 (# per 100 inhabitants)      57.3      104.5      115.2      118.1      115.6      1 (“Percentage of individuals using the Internet,” 2015) 2 (“Mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants,” 2015)Mobile phone subscriptions have grown to exceed a 1:1 ratio in Tunisia, which indicates that some citizens hold multiple phone subscriptions. Internet plans for phones are expensive, which has kept many Tunisians from using these devices to access websites. Most use the Internet at work, in cafés known as publinets, or through USB adapters that connect their computers to 3G data networks (“Freedom House | Tunisia,” 2015).Internet freedomFreedom House, an independent watchdog organization, created an index that measures Internet and digital media freedom by three criteria:  Obstacles to access: “infrastructural and economic barriers to access, legal and ownership control over internet service providers (ISPs), and independence of regulatory bodies”  Limits on content: “legal regulations on content, technical filtering and blocking of websites, self-censorship, the vibrancy/diversity of online news media, and the use of ICTs for civic mobilization”  Violations of user rights: “surveillance, privacy, and repercussions for online activity, such as imprisonment, extralegal harassment, or cyber attacks” (“Freedom on the Net,” 2015)The scores from these three categories are added to get a Freedom on the Net Total, which determines the status level of the country’s Internet freedom—from Free, like Canada, to Not Free, like China.Tunisia’s seen great improvements in its score, moving from its position as an Internet Enemy to a partially free country over the course of a few years.Table 2. Freedom on the Net (“Freedom House | Tunisia,” 2015)            Category      2011      2012      2013      2014                  Obstacles to access (0=best, 25=worst)      21      14      12      11              Limits on content (0=best, 35=worst)      28      12      8      8              Violations of user rights (0=best, 40=worst)      32      20      21      20              Freedom total (0=best, 100=worst)      81      46      41      39              Freedom status      Not Free      Partly Free      Partly Free      Partly Free      Obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of user rights have decreased fairly consistently in Tunisia. Freedom House even notes that the new constitution passed in 2014 protects free speech, privacy of communication data, and bans historic censorship laws on media. They do warn, however, that laws still exist that make defamation, insulting the state, and offending religion illegal. Additionally, access to the Internet is prohibitively expensive for many Tunisians, thanks to an underdeveloped infrastructure and a monopoly on international communications cables by Tunisie Télécom.Some human rights organizations have expressed concerns about the newly established Technical Telecommunications Agency (ATT). It has been likened to the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) because of the body’s autonomy from government intervention and because the agency’s actions are not open to public inquiry (“Freedom House | Tunisia,” 2015).Why this mattersTunisia has seen some of the most significant progress toward open, pluralist reforms in the region post-Arab uprisings. As access to mobile and Internet resources increases, more Tunisians—including politicians—appear to be adopting forms of open discourse on socio-political issues. They have also recently used social media to unite in solidarity against the terrorist attack at the Bardo museum in March 2015 (Mackey, 2015):  Nous n&#39;avons pas peur. We are not afraid. مناش خائفين #TnArp #Bardo #Tounes&mdash; Sayida Ounissi (@SaidaOunissi) March 18, 2015    Sayida Ounissi is a member of the Tunisian Parliament.Shortly thereafter, a wave of support came for Tunisia’s tourism industry when users worldwide proclaimed #IWillComeToTunisia despite the attack (King, 2015).Narratives of social good and of transnational solidarity are inspiring and offer great examples of the promise of social media. We have the potential to connect with each other as humans, despite physical and ideological separations. Though translation services are still far from perfect, not even language barriers are as daunting as they once were.Tunisia’s progress toward free access to the Internet is substantial, but the volatility of that freedom can be seen in concerns expressed about the ATT, which some believe threatens to reverse everything accomplished over the past few years. John Oliver’s interview of Edward Snowden takes a comical approach to discussing the surveillance capabilities of the NSA, but a serious message stands out: if we don’t involve ourselves in the decisions our representatives make about our rights, we risk seeing a reversal of privileges and freedoms we take for granted—like uninhibited access to content on the Internet.Next Up: Social Media in Egypt TodayReferences  Arab Social Media Report.

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Social Media in Egypt Today",
        "excerpt":"Since Mubarak’s removal, Egyptians have struggled to find a leader supportive of their initial cause. Mohamed Morsi was elected in June of 2012 and was removed by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in July 2013. Adly Mahmoud Mansour served as interim president until elections in May of 2014 announced that el-Sisi had won the presidency with 96% of votes. Protests and violence accompanied the political turmoil.Despite—or as a result of—the tumultuous state of the country over the past four years, social media use has steadily increased. We’ll look at statistics from the Arab Social Media Report on social media use in the region as well as data from the UN, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Freedom House in order to assess the state of social media in Egypt today.FacebookEgypt has the second highest rate of use (per capita) of the three countries studied for this project. For Egyptians ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Facebook on January 25, 2011 was at 5.9% (“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015). In May 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 16.2%; by May of 2014, the rate of use was at 22.4%, or 19.4 million people (“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014).  At the end of 2013, Facebook was the most visited website in Egypt. As the mainstream media reverted back to a self-censored, pro-military stance, citizens more heavily relied upon the site to organize and disseminate their messages. In retaliation, pro-government groups have employed tactics such as reporting pages for violations of Facebook’s terms of service in order to have them shut down. Employers have been used to apply pressure to employees who are vocal on social media, and arrests for associations with anti-regime Facebook pages have taken place on repeated occasions. Some organizations, such as the April 6th Movement, have even been banned (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).In spite of efforts to discourage them, many civil and activist organizations have successfully utilized social media for their causes. Kefaya, or “The Egyptian Movement for Change” and Shayfenkom, or “We Can See You,” are examples of online campaigns for political movements, and the “No Military Trials for Civilians” page was used to encourage participation in street protests against unjust treatment by the government. Women’s rights campaigns have also had success in raising awareness for their causes through campaign sites such as HarassMap and NooNeswa (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).TwitterEgypt has the highest rate of Twitter use of the three countries studied for this project. For Egyptians ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Twitter on September 1, 2011 was at 0.15% (“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015). In March 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 0.61%; by March of 2014, the rate of use was at 1.26%, or 1.09 million people (“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014). Egypt’s use of Twitter has contributed significantly to the fact that Arabic is the fastest growing language on the platform (Hamdan, 2013).  When el-Sisi issued an ultimatum to Morsi in 2013, Morsi posted his rejection of it on Twitter.  #الرئيس محمد مرسي يؤكد تمسكه بالشرعية الدستورية ويرفض أي محاولة للخروج عليها ويدعوالقوات المسلحة سحب إنذارها ويرفض أي إملاءات داخليةأوخارجية&mdash; د.محمد مرسي (@MuhammadMorsi) July 2, 2013  Translation: President Mohamed Morsi asserts his grasp on constitutional legitimacy and rejects any attempt to deviate from it, and calls on the armed forces to withdraw their warning and refuses to be dictated to internally or externally (Fitzpatrick, 2013).Then, when el-Sisi announced that he would run for the presidency in 2014, opponents and supporters alike took to Twitter to voice their opinions. A blogger explained that Twitter was “the only arena where [Sisi critics] can express their opposition” (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).Internet and mobile access ratesLike Tunisia, Egypt’s rates of access to the Internet and mobile phones have steadily increased over the past several years. This has occurred despite a weak telecommunications infrastructure in rural and impoverished areas of the country.Internet access is less expensive than in some of Egypt’s neighboring countries, but costs are still prohibitively high because a state-owned provider holds the majority of resources. Some areas of the country are not connected to the landline grid, so they cannot access broadband services at all. Many access the internet at cafés, but Egyptians are required to provide their “names, email addresses, and mobile numbers to receive a personal identification number (PIN) to access the internet” (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).Because of these infrastructural, political, and economic barriers, the Egyptian government does not need to actively censor Internet transmissions. Also, as learned with the Internet shutdown on January 27, 2011 and other blackouts which occurred after that event, “the Egyptian government has centralized internet infrastructure and fiber-optic cables into highly controllable ‘chokepoints’” (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).Table 1. UN/International Telecommunication Union Data            Type      2005      2010      2011      2012      2013                  Internet use 1 (% population)      12.8      31.4      39.8      44.1 (estimated)      49.6              Mobile subscriptions 2 (# per 100 inhabitants)      18.4      90.5      105.1      119.9      121.5      1 (“Percentage of individuals using the Internet,” 2015) 2 (“Mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants,” 2015)Mobile phones have grown to exceed a 1:1 ratio. Phone applications like Viber, WhatsApp, Blackberry Messenger, and other Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) are popular means of communication, though the government explicitly prohibits placing international calls from mobile 3G networks. In June 2014, a leaked document revealed the Egyptian Ministry of Interior planned to buy technology to “conduct real-time monitoring of social media and communication apps such Facebook, Twitter, Viber, and WhatsApp” (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).Internet freedomThe categories that Freedom House uses to determine how free a country’s access to the Internet is were defined in Sunday’s post. The scores from these three categories are added to get a Freedom on the Net Total, which determines the status level of the country’s Internet freedom—from Free, like Canada, to Not Free, like China. With a score of 60, Egypt is right on the cusp of being categorized as Not Free, the category for countries scoring between 61 and 100 on Freedom House’s scale.Table 2. Freedom on the Net (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015)            Category      2011      2012      2013      2014                  Obstacles to access (0 = best, 25 = worst)      12      14      15      15              Limits on content (0 = best, 35 = worst)      14      12      12      12              Violations of user rights (0 = best, 40 = worst)      28      33      33      33              Freedom total (0 = best, 100 = worst)      54      59      60      60              Freedom status      Partly Free      Partly Free      Partly Free      Partly Free      In contrast to Tunisia, obstacles to access and violations of user rights have increased since the Arab uprisings in 2011. Limits on content have gone down, but self-censorship has increased. Freedom House explains that this is because the “country’s highly divisive political environment has resulted in increasing verbal harassment between social media users and a declining willingness to speak out on contentious issues, resulting in self-censorship” (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).Civilians have been subjected to military trials based on comments or media they have posted online, and seven year sentences have been issued for protesting in the streets. Violence and torture of citizens and journalists is still prevalent. In March of 2014, journalist Mayada Ashraf was killed by a sniper while covering a protest. However, Freedom House still reports that “Egyptians remain adept at utilizing social media as an instrument for positive change” (“Freedom House | Egypt,” 2015).Why this mattersEgypt’s story seemed the most promising and is now one of the most sobering situations in the MENA region since the Arab uprisings first began in 2011.It tells a story of battles won over the influence of Egypt’s mainstream media:  Egyptians recognise that ‘older media’, such as television and radio, though accessed by most, tend to be biased. Still State TV, run by the ruling military, remains most popular, and domestic corporate media channels are self-serving and volatile in their coverage. Yet activists have explained to me that they can influence some of these media from the ‘outside in’ by documenting videos of protests, creating credible blogs, and tweeting stories to influence both international and domestic journalists. I saw these strategies in action in July, 2012 at a recent 23000+ person sit-in in Mahalla, the birthplace of Egypt’s labour movement. While this protest was sparsely reported on by the mainstream media, I observed how activists were using video cameras, blogs, and Facebook/Twitter connections to force this coverage from the outside-in (Srinivasan, 2012).It illustrates how social media technologies can and will be used by both sides of a struggle:  “We were the kings of social media, and now our enemies are catching up with us.” With these words, Ahmed Maher, 2011 revolutionary hero and co-founder of the April 6th Youth Movement, explained to me that today’s battle for political power has two-fronts (Srinivasan, 2012).And, like it or not, this technology—or something derivative of it—is here to stay:  From 70+ year old military generals’ use of Facebook to release announcement, to the Muslim Brotherhood’s use of hackers, leaders from the entire range of Egypt’s political factions are striving for the upper hand in this fight (Srinivasan, 2012).Most importantly, however, is the message that “We will watch, listen, and if we do not like what we see - we will rise again” (Srinivasan, 2012).Next Up: Social Media in Libya TodayReferences  Arab Social Media Report.

        "excerpt":"Libya has struggled to achieve peace and stability. After Gaddafi’s death, the country broke into factions based on tribes, regions, and even cities. In July of 2012, Libya’s first parliamentary elections were held and the National Transitional Congress (NTC) handed power over to the General National Congress (GNC). Sectarian attacks continued, and an Islamist militant attack on the American consulate in Benghazi in September 2012 resulted in the death of a U.S. ambassador and three other people. In October 2012, the Libyan Prime Minister was ousted. His successor was removed by March 2013 and replaced by the current Prime Minister, Abdullah al-Thani.In June 2014, elections were held to fill the Council of Deputies—the organization that was to replace the GNC—but when secularists and liberals did well, Islamist lawmakers rejected the results of the elections and refused to recognize the Council of Deputies. Islamists and their supporters established a New General National Congress in Tripoli, and those elected to the Council of Deputies fled to Tobruk. The country has been in a state of civil war since then, which has left room for militant groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to take advantage of uncontrolled areas.Social media use has steadily increased in Libya as it has in Tunisia and Egypt. We’ll look at statistics from the Arab Social Media Report, the UN, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Freedom House in order to assess its role in Libya today.FacebookLibya has the lowest rate of Facebook use of the three countries studied for this project. For Libyans ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Facebook on February 16, 2011 was at 4.21%. In May 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 13.5%, or 878,400 people (“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015).  In 2013, Facebook was the most visited site in Libya. It has served as a source of news for Libyans. Many city and government officials used it to share updates and communications with their constituents. Citizens used it for political campaigns like the “No Extension of GNC” movement, which protested the GNC retaining power after its transitional deadline had passed.TwitterLibya has the lowest rate of Twitter use of the three countries studied for this project. For Libyans ages 13 and above, the rate of use of Twitter on September 1, 2011 was at 0.07% (“Arab Social Media Report,” 2015). In March 2013 (see below), this rate had increased to 0.22%; by March of 2014, the rate of use was at 0.67%, or 44,100 people (“Citizen Engagement and Public Services in the Arab World: The Potential of Social Media,” 2014).  Like Facebook, Twitter has also been used in political and civic campaigns. Recently, Tunisians bombarded US ambassador Deborah Jones with criticism after she tweeted about unconfirmed deaths in an air strike:  Terrible news today from #Tarhouna where 8 innocent displaced #Tawergha killed in air strikes. This violence serves no one&#39;s interests.&mdash; Safira Deborah (@SafiraDeborah) March 23, 2015  Jones shut down her Twitter account due to the onslaught resulting from this post (Stephen, 2015).Internet and mobile access ratesLibya’s rates of Internet access are the lowest of the three countries in this project. The damage of war can be attributed to much of the country’s struggle to provide and maintain information and communications technology (ICT) since 2011. Multiple Internet blackouts have occurred due to vandalism and technical failures. The Facebook page “I hate Libyan Telecom and Technology,” was created to protest Libya’s unreliable telecommunications services. It gained over 20,000 followers (“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015).Common points of access to the Internet include homes, workplaces, mobile phones, and hotel lobbies. Cybercafés were severely damaged during the war but are reportedly beginning to make a comeback. The majority of Internet users gain access through wireless WiMax service. Broadband subscriptions are very low, at a rate of just over 1 subscription per 100 residents (“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015). Two-way satellite Internet technology has also been used by both foreign and Libyan organizations such as Al Jazeera and Libya Alhurra.Table 1. UN/International Telecommunication Union Data            Type      2005      2010      2011      2012      2013                  Internet use 1 (% population)      3.9 (estimated)      14.0 (estimated)      14.0      14.0 (estimated)      16.5              Mobile subscriptions 2 (# per 100 inhabitants)      34.7      180.4      163.8      155.8      165.0      1 (“Percentage of individuals using the Internet,” 2015) 2 (“Mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants,” 2015)Libya’s mobile phone ratio is the highest of the three countries reviewed for this project. Their heavy use for posting messages, photos, and videos during the 2011 uprisings illustrates their ubiquity. The price of mobile phone subscriptions in Libya dropped when competition was allowed into the country in 2003, which made the technology more accessible to Libyans. Freedom House notes that “smartphones and 3G connectivity have been available since 2006, though the prohibitive cost of compatible handsets impedes their wider dissemination” (“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015).Internet freedomThe categories that Freedom House uses to determine how free a country’s access to the Internet is were defined in Sunday’s post. The scores from these three categories are added to get a Freedom on the Net Total, which determines the status level of the country’s Internet freedom—from Free, like Canada, to Not Free, like China. Libya’s 2014 rating places it solidly in the Partly Free status.Table 2. Freedom on the Net (“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015)            Category      2011      2012      2013      2014                  Obstacles to access (0 = best, 25 = worst)      n/a      18      17      18              Limits on content (0 = best, 35 = worst)      n/a      9      9      9              Violations of user rights (0 = best, 40 = worst)      n/a      16      19      21              Freedom total (0 = best, 100 = worst)      n/a      43      45      48              Freedom status      n/a      Partly Free      Partly Free      Partly Free      When it comes to social media, what’s most striking in Libya is the lack of government censorship. Common tools such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are accessible. Freedom House even noted that “the ‘Innocence of Muslims’ film that sparked protests outside the American consulate in Benghazi was not blocked by Libyan authorities, although it was made inaccessible by YouTube’s parent company, Google” (“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015).The greatest threat to free speech in Libya is the threat of violence by militant groups. Activists and journalists receive online threats and have been actively targeted for assassination (“Freedom House | Libya,” 2015).  Utterly devastated &amp; heartbroken...cried myself to sleep Yday..Lost all hope in #Libya #RIP @TBensaud @sami_Elkawafi pic.twitter.com/N0U948l8aV&mdash; Ahmed Sanalla (@ASanalla) September 20, 2014    Youth activist and blogger Tawfik Bensaud was assassinated on September 19, 2014 (Masi, 2014).Many Libyans self-censor their posts online because of threats of violent retaliation and a long history of oppression under Gaddafi, but a growing number of activists and political bloggers have also emerged despite the risks.Social media has also been used to combat social issues, like students being unable to attend school due to the violence surrounding them. Haifa El-Zahawi used social media and Skype to spread the word about her project, The Benghazi School, which offered classes to students through an online portal. Students and teachers hold live classes when they can, but sessions are also recorded and posted online for asynchronous access due to unreliable Internet connectivity. El-Zahawi expressed hope that improved access to education will help deter the radicalization of youth toward groups such as ISIL (International, 2015).Why this mattersThe collapse of Gaddafi’s regime resulted in a socio-political vacuum, which many different groups are now fighting to assume control over (El Kasm, 2011). Acemoglu and Robinson spoke at great lengths about the struggle to break out of a vicious cycle of extractive institutions—systems that enrich the lives of a few at the expense of many. In their book, they seem to directly address the MENA region’s–but particularly Libya’s–current struggle, saying:  A free media and new communication technologies can help only at the margins, by providing information and coordinating the demands and actions of those vying for more inclusive institutions. Their help will translate into meaningful change only when a broad segment of society mobilizes and organizes in order to effect political change, and does so not for sectarian reasons or to take control of extractive institutions, but to transform extractive institutions into more inclusive ones (Acemoglu &amp; Robinson, 2013, p. 462).Zahra Langhi spoke of Libya’s failures in its revolution, acknowledging that Libyans needed “national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division,” and then prescribed “we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy” (Langhi, 2012). Olivos and PaPaioannou reviewed the trends of discussions on three Libyan Facebook pages over the course of three months in 2012 and identified these themes in discussions: Human Rights, Local Themes of Interest within the Libyan Society, the Role of Digital Technologies and Social Mobilization (PaPaioannou &amp; Olivos, 2013, p. 105). This could be interpreted as promising if the researchers’ findings are indicative of a broader shift toward a structure that promotes political inclusion, compassion, and mercy.Next Up: Tunisia TodayReferences  Arab Social Media Report.

        "excerpt":"Summary of events            Year      Month      Events                  2011      January      Ben Ali is removed from rule, and an interim national government is established by Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi.                     February      Ghannouchi resigns from his role as Prime Minister.                     March      A court order dissolves Ben Ali’s political party, Rally for Constitutional Democracy (RCD).                     October      Parliamentary elections are held, and the Ennahda Islamist party wins the largest number of votes. Secularist parties agree to an alliance with Ennahda, which cause some citizens to call them traitors.                     November      The assembly that was elected to draft a new constitution convenes.                     December      Moncef Marzouki is elected President, and Hamadi Jebali becomes Prime Minister.              2012      June      A curfew is imposed by the government after riots increase.                     August      The draft of the constitution is found to reduce women’s rights, which results in protests in Tunis.              2013      February      Large, violent protests occur after anti-Islamist leader, Chokri Belaid, is killed. Demands for government officials to step down increase. Prime Minister Jebali resigns after his Islamist party, Ennahda, rejects a proposal to form a new coalition government in response to the killing.                     May      Clashes between police and protestors escalate.                     July      Politician Mohamed Brahmi is assassinated, which results in mass protests, a general strike, and increased demands for the government’s resignation.                     October      The Ennahda party agrees to hand over power to a caretaker government and new elections are scheduled for 2014.                     December      Mehdi Jomaa is appointed Prime Minister of the Tunisian interim government.              2014      January      Tunisia’s first constitution is passed and signed by the leaders of the secular-Islamist alliance. It was lauded as a reflection of the diversity of Tunisian society and reflective of its pluralism. An interim cabinet is appointed to govern until the new elections are held.                     March      President Marzouki removes the national state of emergency.                     May      Electoral laws are established to govern the legislative and presidential elections.                     October      The Nidaa Tounes party—comprised of secularists and some former party members of Ben Ali’s regime—overtakes the Islamist Ennahda party, winning the largest number of seats in the parliamentary election.                     December      Beji Caid Essebsi of the Nidaa Tounes party is elected President.      2015Tunisia is considered to be the Arab uprisings’ greatest success story. This has has been attributed to some common factors:  The interim government focused first on creating a constitution that established human rights as law and then held elections for a permanent government (LeVine, 2015).  Tunisia didn’t get the international attention or pressure that other countries like Libya and Egypt did, so their transition was more natural (Ryan, 2014, p. 20).  Election results were not interfered with as they were in Egypt; Tunisia’s Islamic government was not removed by the military (McLarney, 2015).  Tunisia is relatively small geographically, and the majority of the population have the same ethnic and religious backgrounds (Keating, 2015).The country held its second round of democratic elections at the end of 2014. Secularist party Nidaa Tounes assumed majority control over parliament and formed a coalition government with Islamist party, Ennahda, in early 2015 (McLarney, 2015).Ongoing issuesOf the triggers attributed to the start of the revolution, repression and censorship have decreased most significantly. Economic disparity and concerns about corruption are still ongoing issues within the country.CorruptionConcerns have been expressed about the election of Essebsi, a remnant of the Bourguiba and Ben Ali eras, and a party which includes several prominent old regime players from the RCD. Teyeb and Levine accused the transitional government of failing to prosecute politicians who worked with or within the Ben Ali regime. As a result, RCD supporters have continued to influence the political, economic, and social realms, contributing to an increase in corruption post-revolution (Teyeb, 2014; LeVine, 2015).Teyeb warns that the “RCD machine” is “implanted in all the components of the State, from public services to education, health sector, business and the media” and that “any setback for Tunisia’s recent democratic achievements will mean a threat to freedom of the press, to transparency and good governance, to political plurality” (Teyeb, 2014).Economic disparityThe Tunisian interim government’s decision to focus first on creating a constitution and a stable political institution has left the economy in a state of neglect: “Today, excitement over the constitution is tempered by economic hardship. Newly acquired political freedoms are widely perceived as having come at the price of economic stability and security” (Ryan, 2014, p. 21). And economic stability plays a hand in the security of the country, as Levine asserts:  The same dynamics of unemployment, marginalisation and lack of a future that helped radicalise the killers of Paris, is also quite present in Tunisia, which accounts for the rapid rise of extremism under the democratic transition, including the disproportionately large participation of young Tunisians in jihadist activities in Iraq and Syria (LeVine, 2015).Extremist groups like ISIL are also threats to internal security. This was underscored in March 2015 when terrorists attacked tourists at the Bardo museum in Tunis.Tunisia’s ambassador to the US, Mohamed Chelaifa acknowledged the need to address socio-economic inequalities, saying “it was Tunisia’s high unemployment and poor economic conditions that sparked the uprising” (Hanley, 2014).Why this mattersParallels can be drawn between Tunisia’s struggles and those we have in the United States:  We have extremists, and sometimes they kill people.  CEOs make up to 774 times as much as minimum wage workers who are protesting for $15 an hour.  The uneducated, the disaffected, and the desperate are targets for recruitment by gangs.  We’ve experienced gridlock in Congress and we’ve seen and heard demands for the removal of leaders.Concerns about corruption and economic disparity are valid but should not undermine the significance of the accomplishments Tunisia has made. If Tunisia’s new leaders find ways to earnestly engage the youth who first called for revolution, it is far more likely that these complex issues can be effectively addressed. Engaging the disenfranchised—giving them a sense of purpose and hope—could also help delegitimize extremist factions looking for recruits.Next Up: Egypt TodayReferences  Tunisia profile - Timeline.

The new parliamentary elections begin.                     December      Prime Minister Kama al-Ganzouri takes office.              2012      January      Islamist parties win the parliamentary elections.                     May      The state of emergency put in place in 1981 ends.                     June      Mohammed Morsi wins the presidential election. Mubarak is sentenced to life in prison.                     August      New Prime Minister Hisham Qandil appoints a new cabinet, which gains criticism for keeping Mubarak’s old defense minister, Hussein Tantawi, and including only a small number of Christians and women. President Morsi eliminates military say in legislation and drafting of a new constitution.                     November      President Morsi issues a decree that keeps the judicial branch from questioning his rule but then retracts it when protests erupt.                     December      A draft constitution which emphasizes the role of Islam and restricts freedom of speech and assembly is approved. The Egyptian public approves it, which triggers protests by Christians, women’s and secular groups.              2013      January      Violent protests result in over 50 killed; Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi warns of a potential state collapse.                     March      President Morsi attempts to move parliamentary elections forward to April but is stopped by the court.                     June      Islamist allies are appointed as regional leaders in half of Egypt’s governorships by Morsi, including one associated with a group that killed tourists in Luxor. Protests and the resignation of Luxor’s governor result.                     July      The SCAF removes Morsi from power, and Adly Mansour is appointed as interim president.                     August      Morsi supporters protesting in Cairo are attacked by security forces. Human Rights Watch reports that at least 1,150 were killed.                     September      The Muslim Brotherhood is banned by the courts.                     November      A law is passed restricting public protests.                     December      The Egyptian government declares the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization after a bombing is attributed to them.              2014      January      A new constitution is drafted, which bans parties based on religion.                     February      Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi and his cabinet resign abruptly.                     May      Abdul Fattah el-Sisi runs for and wins the presidential election.                     June      Three al-Jazeera journalists are imprisoned on charges of spreading false news and associating with the Muslim Brotherhood.                     October      The military is granted additional power and a state of emergency is implemented in Sinai as conflicts with jihadist group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis escalate.                     November      Ansar Beit al-Maqdis announces their loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).      2015In January, violent protests continued as Egypt’s four year anniversary of the overthrow of the Mubarak regime passed. Continued conflicts with terrorist groups in the Sinai have led the government to raze the city of Rafah and create a buffer zone along the border shared with the Gaza Strip. In February, Egypt retaliated to ISIL’s execution of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians by bombing their positions in eastern Libya.Parliamentary elections were set to be held in March but were then suspended. They’re now expected to be held in May or June.Ongoing issuesAll of the problems attributed to the start of Egypt’s revolution—corruption, economic disparity, and repression—have remained the same or become more severe over the past four years. The most significant increase, however, can be seen in the government’s use of military and police force.RepressionIn 2014, presidents Mansour and Sisi put over 140 laws into effect that criminalized new behaviors and increased punishments for existing offenses. Egypt’s war against terrorism has further justified the government’s establishment of more draconian laws.  Since the military takeover of 2013, a public discourse has evolved churning out incessant accounts in which enemies of the Egyptian state and its people, external and internal, known and unknown, human and otherwise, are constantly conspiring to plot against the country and target its security as well as the health of its national economy. Against a rich tapestry of intrigue and terrorist discourse, the security apparatus has emerged, in this narrative, as the only national saviour capable of protecting the country from complete chaos. In fact, the legitimacy of the Sisi regime continues to derive largely from his promise to rid the country of terrorists and to restore security and order. In this regard, he makes grateful use of actual violent attacks against military and other targets especially in Sinai (Abdelrahman, 2015).In March of 2014, Alaa Abdel Fattah, founder of the No Military Trials for Civilians movement, was accused of assaulting a police officer and stealing his communication device during a demonstration. Other officers corroborated this testimony against Fattah, though questions have been raised about the legitimacy of this information, due to conflicting statements. Fattah and another political protestor were jailed pending trial, which is permissible under Egypt’s emergency law: “When the prosecution and judiciary know that the case file isn’t powerful enough to guarantee a jail sentence, they keep the defendant in jail pending the trial, which they decide how long is going to take” (Sabry, 2014). Fattah was sentenced to five years in jail in February of 2015.On April 11th, U.S. citizen Mohamed Soltan was sentenced to life in prison for alleged ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, and over a dozen others were sentenced to death for their involvement in protests against Morsi’s ouster. Morsi himself was sentenced to 20 years in prison today.The U.S. lifted its military supply ban on Egypt at the end of March. As a result, Sisi’s military will be armed with F-16s, missiles, and tanks. Annual military funding of $1.3 billion has also been reinstated (Calamur, 2015).Why this mattersDr. Maha Abdelrahman, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, spoke of the broader implications of what’s happening in Egypt:  An inflated police force is not unique to Egypt. With the rise of neoliberal capitalism and its strategies of ‘accumulation by dispossession’, many regimes, including those in the ‘democratic’ west, have increased investment in policing and surveillance, especially targeting particular localities and populations; namely the poor, the unemployed, migrants and blacks. Different policies such as the infamous ‘stop and search’, the ‘Injunctions for the Prevention of Nuisance and Annoyance’ in the UK and the ‘Prohibited Behaviour Order’ in the State of Western Australia have created a ‘culture of reporting’ and often given increasing discretionary powers to the police (Abdelrahman, 2015).  Summary of scary shit: Heavily militarized police presence in Ferguson. Protests banned. Journalists threatened. News helicopters barred.&mdash; Radley Balko (@radleybalko) August 12, 2014    Radley Balko is an American journalist who writes for the Washington Post and published Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces in 2014.Riots last year in Ferguson, Missouri were met by a militarized police force. The Wall Street Journal noted that “billions of dollars of excess military equipment and funding to buy other gear has flown to local police departments over the past two decades” (Grossman, 2014).Attention to cases of police brutality, especially toward minority groups, has increased in the past year. Yesterday, the New York Times released an article, “1.5 Million Black Men,” which found that “Ferguson has 60 men for every 100 black women in the age group,” and that “incarceration and early deaths are the overwhelming drivers of the gap” (Wolfers, Leonhardt, &amp; Quealy, 2015).Alaa Abdel Fattah’s father spoke at a news conference after his son was first imprisoned: “Is your generation going to pass on to my grandchildren, your children, a better society than that we passed on to you? I hope so; I hope you succeed in what we failed to accomplish. And again, I am sorry. We couldn’t accomplish for you what we had hoped” (Sabry, 2014). The United States and Egypt differ in many distinct ways, but state and federal governments’ actions implicate support for the tactics being used toward citizens in Egypt. We too should sincerely ask ourselves if we’re passing a better society on to future generations.Next Up: Libya TodayReferences  Egypt profile - Timeline. (2015). BBC. arab-uprisings.

        "excerpt":"Summary of events            Year      Month      Events                  2011      October      Gaddafi is killed. The National Transitional Congress (NTC) announces Libya’s liberation and plans to hold elections within eight months.              2012      January      Former rebel forces clash in Benghazi, and Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, the deputy head of the NTC, resigns.                     February      Clashes between rival ethnic groups in the southeast of Libya kill many.                     March      NTC officials in Benghazi conflict with those in Tripoli.                     June      Government forces struggle to suppress local militias; Tripoli’s airport is temporarily commandeered.                     July      Elections are held.                     August      Power is transferred from the TNC to the General National Congress (GNC). Mohammed Magarief is elected to be the interim president.                     September      Islamist militants attack the American consulate in Benghazi, leaving a US ambassador and three other Americans dead.                     October      Ali Zeidan replaces Abdul Raheem Al-Keeb as prime minister.              2013      May      A law which prohibits Gaddafi-era officials from holding public office is passed. The Chairman of the GNC, Muhammad al-Magarief, resigns in compliance.                     June      Nuri Abu Sahmein is elected as GNC chairman.                     August      Militia forces blockade oil export terminals.                     October      An armed militia abducts Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, albeit briefly.                     November      The army clashes with armed Islamists in Benghazi, and nine people are killed.                     December      A suicide attack occurs in Benghazi.              2014      February      Protests erupt in response to the GNC’s refusal to step down after their term expired.                     March      Prime Minister Ali Zeidan is removed from office after the Libyan navy fails to stop a rogue oil tanker from escaping. Abdullah al-Thani takes over in Zeidan’s stead.                     April      Al-Thani negotiates with militia forces to remove blockades for two oil export terminals and, later in the month, submits his resignation.                     May      Ahmed Maiteeq is elected prime minister in al-Thani’s place. Army general Khalifa Haftar defects and launches airstrikes against militant Islamist groups in Benghazi. Haftar also accuses Prime Minister Maiteeq of being tied to Islamists and attempts to storm the parliament building.                     June      Prime Minister Maiteeq’s appointment is deemed illegal; he resigns. Elections have a low turn out due to security concerns and protests. Conflicts arise between supporters of the outbound GNC and the newly elected parliament.                     July      Militant Islamist groups overtake most of Benghazi. Foreigners flee the country.                     October      UN reports that hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by civil war. Talks are brokered between rival governments in Tobruk and Tripoli. ISIL takes over the port of Derna in eastern Libya. The Libyan army regains control of most of Benghazi.      2015The Libyan army and militia forces in Tripoli agreed to a partial ceasefire in January, but Islamist militants continued their violent attacks, killing nine people in an attack on the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli.In February, ISIL released a video of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians being killed; Egypt bombed ISIL targets within Libya in response. Violence continued to escalate, so the Italian government closed its embassy in Tripoli and withdrew all citizens. The law barring Gaddafi-era officials from public office was also lifted this month.In late March, the UN released a plan to end the Libyan conflict, proposing the creation of a transitional unity government that would run the country until a new constitution was approved and elections were held.April thus far has echoed much of the calamity of the previous few months:  Thousands of migrants have fled the country’s violence by sea. Italian authorities estimate that over 10,000 migrants have been picked up within the past several days.  Hundreds died tragically on the route from Libya to Italy just a few days ago.  ISIL has released video from their base in Libya of the killing of 30 Ethiopian Christians.Ongoing issuesPrime Minister of Italy Matteo Renzi spoke of recent tragedies: “I think the Mediterranean is a sea and not a cemetery. The problem at this moment is the situation on the ground in Libya” (“Libya crisis: Obama appeals to Gulf states,” 2015). The triggers attributed to the start of Libya’s revolution—volatility, corruption, and repression—have remained the same or increased slightly in the past four years.In 2012, Zahra Langhi spoke about why Libya’s revolution didn’t work, pointing out that:  Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions. For four decades Gaddafi’s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society…Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles – freedom, dignity, social justice – that we first held. Intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution (Langhi, 2012).Today, President Obama is trying to encourage Gulf countries to help with the restoration of stability in Libya. It’s expected that the European Union will also become more involved as they encounter greater numbers of migrants seeking refuge at their borders.Why this mattersIn 2011 Ed Husain, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, asserted that “democracy is about much more than removal of dictators and elections” and then noted that “the lack of Arab outcry, for example, about the public manhandling and mobile-phone recording of his [Gaddafi’s] blood-stained corpse by his killers is an indication that yesterday’s rebels are not necessarily prepared to embrace democratic culture” (Husain, 2011).Tunisia still experiences challenges but has had the most success establishing a democracy thus far. Egypt is back under severe military rule, though demands for democracy can still be seen and heard. In Libya, the struggle isn’t a clear battle with “the people” on one side and “the regime” on the other; citizens are stuck in the middle of a war between the government and armed militias or armed militias fighting other militias.Libya’s diffuse population, isolated from the concept of civil and political institutions for over 40 years, likely plays a part in the unique struggle we’re witnessing. The country’s oil wealth also likely plays a role. When comparing Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya’s current statuses, what stands out most is the fact that the international community only intervened in Libya’s uprisings. Had there been no intervention, it’s possible that rebel forces would have been defeated, and the bloodshed in the country could have been far worse, like in Syria. But even after international intervention, ISIL has taken advantage of the power vacuum and established a foothold in Libya. So perhaps the question of intervention’s role shouldn’t be a binary comparison between intervention and non-intervention, but rather one of the approach and commitment of the intervenors.Rory Stewart, a British diplomat and politician said:  Intervention is far more uncertain than any conceivable domestic policy. You are charging into a dark room, unsure whether there is even a floor beneath your feet. There is no magic plan, nor quantity of resources, that can guarantee success…If there is a lesson from all these countries, it is that there is no substitute for detailed experience in a particular place. The best the west can do is to rely on more people who are focused on the specific history and culture of Libya, more attentive to the realities of rural life (Stewart, 2011).Next Up: ConclusionReferences  Chandler, D.

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Conclusion",
        "excerpt":"In his book, Writing on the wall: Social media, the first 2,000 years, Standage is quick to point out that “social media does not merely connect us to each other today—it also links us to the past” (Standage, 2013, p. 89). Protestors have used media devices to disseminate messages of solidarity and of dissent for generations.In the Arab uprisings, the ability with which citizens united and coordinated their message was undoubtedly facilitated by social media, but the experience gained from organized movements of the past was imperative to their efficacy. The main conclusions that can be drawn from this project are that:Social media did not cause the Arab uprisings.Underlying grievances of corruption, repression, economic disparity, and censorship triggered them. Social media empowered citizens to find their voice as a people (sha’b). It enabled them to organize and to expose injustice. It spread their messages quickly. And most importantly, it garnered a broad audience.Social media played a significant role in the Arab uprisings.It enabled a “synchronization of opinion” (Standage, 2013, p. 1044) across the MENA region as dissatisfied individuals identified common offenses made by their governments and established a unified demand for dignity and freedom from oppression. Solidarity was key. Politics of dominance and exclusion don’t work, as can be seen most clearly in Libya today.Social media is more than a tool.It’s a platform for cultural and political expression which can be used to augment the voices of a movement. Corrupt institutions fear the discovery of this voice, which can be seen in the history of censorship and repression in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.The facilitation of communication and political expression was critical to the Arab uprisings. It offered citizens of repressive countries a window to the outside and allowed them to learn from people who had experience holding peaceful political protests or solicit help from those who were connected to large audiences.Social media is not a panacea.The ease and speed with which a message can be disseminated is social media’s source of power and its greatest weakness. Ordinary individuals can speak for themselves rather than relying upon media conglomerates to do it for them, but these benefits don’t come without consequences:  Morozov notes, the Internet “penetrates and reshapes all walks of political life, not just the ones conducive to democratization.” Anyone who hopes that the Internet will spread Western-style liberal democracy must bear in mind that the same digital tools have also been embraced by campaigners with very different aims, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and ultra-right-wing nationalist groups in Russia (Standage, 2013, p. 4097).Social media moves so quickly that it sets up an expectation of equally fast results. As can be seen in Egypt and Libya, rapid changes can’t necessarily be equated with permanent ones. Tunisians are learning that changing the infrastructure of a country takes a lot of time and effort.  While active citizenship and civil participation among young Tunisians is critical to sustaining the country’s positive socio-economic momentum and achieving political stability, very few engage in any form of political participation, except mobilizing for demonstrations. In fact, youth activism is done in an ad-hoc manner with social media as the mobilizing tool, outside the formally established civil and political institutions (“World Bank Report: Young People in Tunisia Still Frustrated by Social and Economic Obstacles,” 2014).This can be discouraging, but inaction isn’t an effective alternative. The consequences of inaction impact more than just those in the MENA region—refugees are flocking to European Union countries’ shores to escape violence and poverty.Social media adds complexity.As more and more voices enter the arena, it can be difficult to identify a single message. Greater freedom of expression is extended without bias, so “bad ideas will proliferate as well as good ones,” (Standage, 2013, p. 4119) but this also means that divergent messages can be debated out in the open and acknowledged rather than ignored.The complexity of this system can also cause us to be distracted by events rather than the root of an issue. “We live in an exaggerated present—we pay too much attention to recent experience and too little attention to the past, focusing on current events rather than long term behavior” (Meadows &amp; Wright, 2008, p. 1934). This is why it was important to look at the history of Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya when trying to understand social media’s role in the Arab uprisings.Social media isn’t going away.System dynamics scientist Donella Meadows said that “self-organization is such a basic property of living systems that even the most overbearing power structure can never fully kill it, although in the name of law and order, self-organization can be suppressed for long, barren, cruel, boring periods” (Meadows &amp; Wright, 2008, p. 1402). The social media of today—Twitter, Facebook, and the like—are the latest iteration of self-organization in humanity, but they are not likely to be the last. As we learn, diversify, and increase in complexity, new communication and organizational systems will develop.Why this all mattersThis was a difficult subject to get people to engage with me on, but that reinforces a fundamental point of the project: social media doesn’t motivate change in and of itself. We are motivated by the things we feel.I have been reading a lot about the protests against police brutality toward people of color. As I write, protests are taking place because of the suspicious death of Freddie Gray after being arrested by Baltimore police. This morning, I came across this music video produced for Run the Jewels’ song, Close Your Eyes:  As the video played out, tears began—and would not stop—streaming down my face. Even now as I think about it, I am emotionally affected by the message of the video. You can read the full director’s statement on Run the Jewels’ site, but here’s what stood out:  For me, it was important to write a story that didn’t paint a simplistic portrait of the characters of the Cop and Kid. They’re not stereotypes. They’re people - complex, real people and, as such, the power had to shift between them at certain points throughout the story…I believe that it is important that the way we feel when we see these events in real life has an effect on us. That we resonate with what we know to be right and we don’t numb ourselves out so those feelings can simply be swept away, we must confront them and take some action, however small, or we’ll be stuck in the same cycle of violence and hate.The goal of this project is not to provide answers to the cause of the Arab uprisings as much as it is to open up a dialogue about the many faces and forms of injustice; social media is a platform which can be used to make others aware of injustices and unite against them.Thinking differently about the struggle for dignity and identifying it as a human right is the first step toward taking action to combat injustice. You don’t have to go to another country to make a difference in this. That struggle for dignity is happening in the US, as well, and the world is watching:  Power &amp; tyranny are different. In some countries like US, police are seemingly powerful but they kill innocents. #FreddieGray #RekiaBoyd&mdash; Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) April 26, 2015    The greatest threat to the U.S. is not ISIS or Russia.. But their racist roots!! people are waking up and they don&#39;t like it!! #FreddieGray&mdash; عبد العزيز الفريدي (@AzozAlfuraydi) April 26, 2015    &quot;Patriots&quot; are supposed to resist their oppressors. It&#39;s their God-given right. But only if they&#39;re white. #FreddieGray&mdash; Imani Gandy (@AngryBlackLady) April 26, 2015  Another critical step in combatting injustice is speaking out against it. Maryam Al Khawaja spoke clearly on the consequences of silence:  The governments will continue to try and silence people. In Syria, Yemen, Egypt, and Bahrain, they will continue to torture, detain, use excessive force, and kill, as long as the people and political leaders of this world choose to stay silent. They will continue to kill their citizens until Western governments realize that their real interest lies in countries with real democracies, not authoritarian regimes. Until they realize that the best way to create stability is by including people and treating them like citizens, not by silencing them and tying their hands to provide a fake calm in the country (Al Khawaja, 2012, p. 780).The actions we do or do not take against inequality communicate much more about our values than mere words do. Don’t be silent, and be sure to back up what you say matters with actions.“Sitting at home and just following us on news or Facebook leads to our humiliation….if you stay at home, then you deserve all that’s being done to you and you will be guilty before your nation and your people…never say there’s no hope! Hope disappears only when you say there’s no hope…God says that He ‘will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.’” Asmaa MahfouzNext Up: AnalysisReferences  Standage, T.

        "title": "Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Analysis",
        "excerpt":"This project is the culmination point of my Master of Science in Global Technology and Development at Arizona State University. As such, I’ve been asked to analyze what this all means in terms of social media and social movements beyond the Arab uprisings.Among its many uses, social media has acted as a platform for individuals to vocalize their opposition toward repressive political structures. It has afforded them a voice of dissent toward mainstream media sources—in many places considered to be controlled or manipulated by the state government—and toward government leaders themselves. As such, social media has acted as a democratizing agent by allowing the dissatisfied or disenfranchised to bypass sometimes elaborate barriers of censorship or bureaucracy in order to be heard by a broader audience. It will continue to be used in this manner.Earlier this week I learned that a Baltimore activist, Joseph Kent, had been taken by police while trying to get people out after curfew to disperse. The reaction on Twitter was immediate and intense; tweets referencing #JosephKent demanded answers for his apprehension and his wellbeing. On April 30th, he was released. The attention drawn to his arrest on social media is attributed to his swift release. This illustrates the speed of accountability that social media offers. This is where efforts toward long-lasting change begin.Social media is being taken seriously by political institutions; the Pentagon has invested in research on the dynamics of social movements, and Egyptian police are looking to improve their social media-monitoring software. The ease with which oppressive governments can and have used technology to monitor and/or oppress citizens presents another angle which needs to be considered when anticipating the future of social media and social movements. The tactics used in the Arab uprisings and elsewhere may not be as effective now that governments know better what to expect and are better prepared.Social media is an invaluable resource for coordinated efforts, spreading messages quickly and efficiently among individuals, but once a synchronization of opinion is accomplished, organized actions must follow. The speed at which social media facilitated a global conversation about freedom and dignity in the MENA region left many youth with the expectation of equally quick changes to their political institutions. That has been a disappointment across all three countries that I studied, but it shouldn’t discourage continued efforts toward more inclusive institutions. Social media’s structure is agile in a way that most government structures are not. Efforts to engage communities where they live—virtually and physically—will need to be made.Social media in the general sense has been a part of human history for far longer than Facebook and Twitter have existed; it’s unlikely that it will go away anytime soon. I can’t predict the outcome of the Arab uprisings any more effectively than I can predict the outcome of the protests occurring in Baltimore today. What I can assert with a reasonable amount of certainty is that change will be enacted by those who can motivate others to actively and personally engage—to build community groups, to unite in protest, to speak out in solidarity, to petition representatives, and to engage in what has become a global dialogue about inequality and government corruption. These are common factors for many of the uprisings following those in the MENA region:  Iceland’s revolution  The Occupy movements  The Gezi Park protests  The Ferguson protests  The Black Lives Matter Movement  Hong Kong’s protestsSocial media is but one component of revolutionary change. What determines the fate of a people is determined in the streets, in the courthouses, in the classrooms, in the workplaces. Change occurs in the places where we meet each other eye to eye.","categories": [],

        "title": "The Balkans: Introduction",
        "excerpt":"IntroductionMy wife, Rachel, and I recently traveled to the Balkans. We intentionally chose Sarajevo as the starting point for our visit, which may have had something to do with my obsession with the history of the city and surrounding region.The Bosnian war was happening when I was in middle-high school. It’s where and when my interest in media technology’s role in conflict and the definition of cultural/nationalist identities began. In high school, I wrote a paper expressing my naive distress about a world which had allowed genocide to occur yet again. Over the past 20 years I’ve continued to watch, read, and write about the Balkans, Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular.The breakup of Yugoslavia affords us an opportunity to look at our own cultural and nationalistic identities and imagine potential outcomes. Sarajevo is a beautiful and solemn monument to the volatility of peace and the complexity of identity. I’ll talk about this more in upcoming posts, but if that isn’t your particular cup of tea, stick around! I’ll also share entertaining things about our trip. But first, a brief foray into the history of the former Yugoslavia, which should help future references make a bit more sense.Crash Course in Modern South Balkan HistoryYugoslaviaYugoslavia, or Jugoslavija, comes from the combination of the Croatian word ‘jug’ for ‘south’ and ‘slaveni’ to indicate a people of Slavic descent. It started out as a kingdom of former territories of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, post-World War I. The Serbian royal family was the Yugoslav royal dynasty.World War IIDuring World War II, the country was occupied by Axis forces and divided up into parts: Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Serbia, and Slovenia. Nationalist factions developed within these subdivisions of the country, and two resistance forces arose in opposition to Axis occupation: the Yugoslav Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, and the Chetniks who were decidedly pro-Serbian and eventually turned against the Partisans. The Partisans succeeded in freeing Yugoslavia from Axis powers in 1945, abolished the Serbian royal family and government, and made Yugoslavia a communist state.Josip Broz TitoJosip Broz Tito was the leader of the Partisans. His Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia existed until 1990 and was comprised of six republics known today as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Slovenia, and Serbia, plus the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.sourced from WikipediaThe people we met on our trip spoke with varying degrees of enthusiasm about Tito’s leadership. Most admitted that they had never directly experienced Tito’s Yugoslavia because they were too young, but general sentiment toward him skewed positive. He was an authoritarian ruler, yes, but one that maintained peace and provided stability. Those who criticized him weren’t guaranteed the same protections.Locals put a lot of emphasis on the fact that Tito’s version of communism was different than that of Stalinist Russia. Tito did, in fact, break with Stalin in 1948, and Yugoslavia became an independent communist state. He aligned with other countries that wanted a system somewhere in between the capitalism of the West and communism of the East.Ethnic tensionWhen Tito’s party took over leadership of Yugoslavia, nationalism was banned from being publicly promoted, but protestors voiced concerns that Yugoslavia was still a Serb hegemony. In 1974, Tito responded in part by reducing Serbian influence through the creation of autonomous regions: Kosovo and Vojvodina. The new regions appeased groups concerned with Serbs’ influence and consequently upset Serbs, whose political position was diminished. Autonomous regions were given the same voting capability as republics but differed from them in one major way: they could not separate from Yugoslavia, whereas republics technically had the right to secede (this detail is important later).Economic downturnThe price of oil dropped in the 1970s and triggered an economic crisis in Yugoslavia. Debt increased and demand for Yugoslavian products decreased. Unemployment rose. I suspect we’re all familiar with the kind of discomfort these economic changes can cause in a society.Death of TitoTito died in 1980, and an eight-member council of representatives—one for each republic and autonomous region—replaced him. Ethnic tensions rose again. Kosovo wanted to be recognized as a republic rather than an autonomous entity, and Serbs were becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to pass legislation, despite being the largest ethnic group in Yugoslavia.Slobodan MiloševićMilošević was the council member representing Serbia. He wanted to make Serbia great again by restoring its sovereignty. From 1986 to 1989, he successfully destabilized the governments of Montenegro, Vojvodina, and Kosovo and replaced existing leaders with his allies. This significantly reduced Vojvodina and Kosovo’s autonomy and secured four guaranteed votes in the council, including one for Serbia.In 1987, an ambitious Serbian Communist party leader, Slobodan Milosevic…pointed his finger in the distance— at what Mother Tatiana had labeled out there— and, as legend now has it, pledged: “They’ll never do this to you again. Never again will anyone defeat you.”At that moment, as the crowd roared, the Serbian revolt against the Yugoslav federation began; it soon spread laterally to the other republics. One by one, Serbs gathered the courage to remove the fearful icon of Tito from their homes and shops, replacing it with a photo of the plump, baby-faced Milosevic. The only Eastern European Communist leader in the late 1980s who managed to save himself and his party from collapse did so by making a direct appeal to racial hatred.Kaplan, Robert D. (2014-04-01). Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History (Kindle Locations 1281-1287). Picador. Kindle Edition.The breakup of YugoslaviaEthnic Albanians in Kosovo organized strikes in 1989, and those turned into broader demonstrations demanding Kosovo be recognized as a republic. In early 1990, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia convened. Milošević and the Serbian delegates argued in favor of a “one person, one vote” policy which would benefit the Serb-majority within Yugoslavia. Slovenian and Croatian delegates pushed for greater power within the republics and were voted down. They then left the Congress; the Communist party of Yugoslavia was dissolved.Yugoslav WarsYugoslavia did not deteriorate suddenly, but gradually and methodically, step by step, through the 1980s, becoming poorer and meaner and more hate-filled by the year. That’s why every conversation I had was so sad. We were all shouting to the outside world about a coming catastrophe, but no one wanted to hear our awful secret. No one was interested.Kaplan, Robert D. (2014-04-01). Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History (Kindle Locations 716-718). Picador. Kindle Edition.Nationalistic stances took rise as Slovenia and Croatia continued to loosen their ties to the Federation. War broke out when the republics tried to replace Yugoslav civilian and military forces with secessionist ones.In mid-1991, Slovenia and Croatia both declared independence from Yugoslavia. Slovenia’s war for independence lasted ten days, whereas the Croatian and Bosnian wars for independence took over four years. The differences in war durations are related (in part) to a higher number of ethnic Serbs living in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina than in Slovenia. Serbs opposed the countries’ secessions from Yugoslavia and wanted Serb-majority areas of the countries to remain in a common state with Serbia. Serbs voted in November 1991 to form a Serbian republic within the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to do just that, and in January 1992 they announced a separate Republika Srpska. Just over a month later, Bosnia-Herzegovina declared its independence from Yugoslavia. Bosnian Serbs rejected the referendum and declared Republika Srpska’s independence from Bosnia-Herzegovina on April 5th; the Bosnian war officially started the following day.Further ReadingThere’s a whole lot more to the story! A lot of specifics were skipped if they weren’t directly relevant to the account of our trip. If you want to learn more about the region, actors, or wars, I recommend taking a look at what Wikipedia has to offer. It’s relatively clear and concise and can send you spiraling blissfully down a rabbit hole of information if you dig into the citations. I’ve included links to some such pages in the text above.I’m currently reading Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, and Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve read thus far. I’ve also read and recommend checking out these books if you’re interested in going deeper into this subject:  The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914  Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History  War Is a Force That Gives Us MeaningComing SoonI’ll share photos and stories from:  Bosnia: Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and the trip south through Mostar  Croatia: Dubrovnik, Korčula, Split, Plitvice lakes, and Zagreb  Slovenia: Ljubljana, Vintgar gorge, Lake Bled, and Hiša Franko  Italy: Venice","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Welcome to SarajevoWe landed in Sarajevo in the evening and took in a view of the surrounding mountains at dusk while waiting to go through customs. Cigarette smoke wafted in the air. Though travel forums suggested we could, neither of us were able to find a place in the airport to buy a local SIM card, so we went to the taxi stand, I gave the driver the address of our apartment, and we were off.The drive from the airport to the old city where we were staying was about twenty minutes. Cars are restricted within the main portion of the old city, so the driver dropped us off as close to the heart of it as he could. He then admitted he didn’t know where the actual address of our apartment was, so we found a police officer, and he recruited the help of another person. They told us it was walkable but uphill and suggested we take another cab there, so we did. That was the right decision.Pro Tip: Print a map of directions to your apartment prior to traveling to a place you know you’ll be without phone/data service. Flat-landers, check the topographic view of the area to better understand what you’re getting into.I rang the bell for the wrong apartment, woke a friendly-sounding British person, and then shone my light on the panel only to discover a faint “Airbnb” written beside the buzzer right below the one I rang. Once settled, we rejoiced at Rachel’s brilliant plan to save the mini-bottles of wine handed out on our flight for this very moment: our adventure in the Balkans had begun.                                                                                              We sat on our porch every morning and evening to listen to sounds of the city like this:Calls to prayer in SarajevoWe only had four days in Sarajevo, and one was to be spent in Srebrenica, so we dove right in the next day.SiegeA difficult ethnic history will not, by itself, necessarily cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in conditions resembling the Holocaust. For that calamity, one needs additional factors: Western confusion and inaction which, in turn, create a power vacuum. Without these other elements, the horrors of the 1990s might not have occurred.Kaplan, Robert D. (2014-04-01). Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History (Kindle Locations 86-88). Picador. Kindle Edition.We went on a tour of several places within and around the city to learn about the siege by Serbian forces, which started in 1992.You don’t have to use much imagination to feel the loss Sarajevo has experienced. Row after row of tombstones fill hillsides and are wedged in between homes and in parks. Some tombs are from the time of the Ottoman Empire; most dates fall between 1992 and 1996.                                                                                                                                                                                        Loss is an obvious part of the city and the people’s identity; so are defiance and resilience. The siege of Sarajevo lasted nearly four years. On average, nearly 330 bombs were dropped per day in an effort to break the morale of those within the city. Snipers were spread out around the 70 kilometer siege perimeter, and supply lines into the city were cut or constrained. In response, Sarajevans used guerilla warfare to combat their opponents, and the Tunel Spasa was built to transport people and goods in and out of the city.We passed the war cemetery every time we went out; every day the sunrise and sunset were breathtaking. Enjoying something beautiful while simultaneously feeling sad about such a significant loss is complicated. A little backgroundIn this region, one’s ethnicity determines their expected religious affiliation. Bosniaks are Muslim, Croats are Catholic, and Serbs are Orthodox. Today, each major ethnic group in the country is represented by a democratically elected president, legislative, judicial, and local officials. This was the structure defined by the Dayton Accords. The Dayton Agreement was established as the transitional constitution for Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH); it is still in place today, as a new constitution has not been agreed upon.Our guide noted that the presidents of BiH must agree unanimously in order to enact new laws or create a new constitution. This makes it nearly impossible for anything to get done. Much of the population’s focus is therefore on local efforts. He emphasized that people make things happen and that they had given up on government.Nothing seemed overtly tense during our time in Sarajevo. Both of our guides’ perspectives were that Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs lived together quite well prior to the war and that nationalism is what broke them apart. They used the proximity of old Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, and Orthodox places of worship as an historic example of peaceful coexistence.Old CityWe liked exploring the old city early in the day when it wasn’t as busy, but the energy of the area when the streets are filled with shop owners, cafe-goers, pigeon-feeders, and people-watchers was warm and electric.Listen:Music playing at Barhana cafe at lunchtime                                                                                                                                                                                        We saw a broad range of liberal and conservative religious folks, all intermingling within the old city. Sarajevo itself feels more secular. From the people we spoke to, it seems that, much like in the US, many people associate with a religion (primarily based on culture/ethnicity) and observe religious holidays but are otherwise neutral.Walking tourThe city’s full of interesting little details, so we explored and found indications of the area’s Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Capitalist, and Communist influences. A little bit of something for everyone, really. Check out the details in each photo for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                        After all that walking, imagine sitting down in a bar filled with artifacts from different places and times, ordering a drink, and listening to this:Music playing at Zlatna ribica (goldfish) barIt was the perfect ending to our day and time in Sarajevo.Coming SoonPhotos and stories from our day trip to Srebrenica.Further ReadingFor a little bit different take on Bosnia, Sarajevo, and the war, check out Joe Sacco’s graphic novels.

        "title": "The Balkans: Srebrenica",
        "excerpt":"Into Republika SrpskaBosnia has two autonomous entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Republika Srpska (RS). Sarajevo is within the Federation of BiH, and Srebrenica is in Republika Srpska. There are no border crossings between these regions, so the best way to tell which you’re in is by looking at the road signs; the Federation of BiH uses the Latin alphabet, and Republika Srpska uses Cyrillic. Republika Srpska is predominantly Serb, and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is mostly Bosniak to the north, Croat to the south.On September 25th, the tour group consisted of Rachel and me, so our guide drove us two-and-a-half hours northeast to the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial. We passed from the Federation region into Republika Srpska without ceremony.The fog was heavy as we wound through the mountains of the Dinaric Alps. The forests were thick and felt very old. I have never seen terrain like what we drove through that day. There weren’t many places to stop and take photos, and I didn’t feel right taking any in the car while talking with our guide. He was substituting for his brother who was unable to make it at the last moment. He seemed tense, so we talked about 90s hip hop and the movies he watched to teach himself English.We turned off onto a smaller country road and wound through farm land. The fog was thick until late in the morning. Conversation about US pop culture naturally turned to questions about our current presidential election, and our guide posited that the area we were driving through was one that would likely vote for Trump. He then pointed at a flock of sheep and said they would vote for him, too, and baahed “Truuuuump!” We didn’t get much deeper into the conversation than that. It was enough.Referendum dayA while later, our guide apologized for driving slowly and explained that that day was referendum day in Republika Srpska and he wanted to be careful. A contentious vote was being held to determine whether the region would declare its own national day (separate from the rest of the country) on the date of its founding in 1992. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s constitutional court had declared the referendum unconstitutional for discriminating against Bosniaks and Croatians, but the region proceeded with the referendum anyway.Our guide was a Bosniak and noted that the police are predominantly Serb, so he didn’t want to risk getting pulled over. He pointed out the Serbian flags hanging from homes and on fences as we continued driving. It reminded me of the Confederate flags I grew up seeing hung on porches and in the backs of trucks, and it made me feel a similar kind of discomfort. I understand why he didn’t want to attract unnecessary attention.The referendum was an act of defiance against the unified state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Republika Srpska’s president, Milorad Dodik is a huge proponent of seceding from Bosnia-Herzegovina and has promised to hold a referendum to decide on that in 2018. Most believe it’s unlikely to occur since Republika Srpska, though backed by Russia, lacks broader international support. If they were to succeed, it would effectively destroy the peace accords established in Dayton.SrebrenicaThe Srebrenica Genocide Memorial, or Srebrenica-Potočari Memorial and Cemetery for the Victims of the 1995 Genocide officially, is tucked between the mountains in a broad valley about 10km outside of the city of Srebrenica itself. The museum was closed on the day we were there due to the referendum, so we walked around the cemetery in relative quiet. There were many places where visitors could sit alone and reflect or gather together and pray.50,000 people; 300 UN soldiers to protect against 5,000 militia; over 8,000 men and boys killedRachel and our guide were both using the restroom when I saw cars with Serbian flags driving by and honking their horns, likely in celebration of the referendum.                                                                                              As we looked over the wall of names of those buried, our guide noted that the date of death indicated on the tombstones reflects the year that person’s death was actually confirmed; people whose death years were more recent didn’t necessarily die then. That’s just when their remains were identified.It’s been over 20 years since the massacre. They’re still digging and finding bodies.                                                                It was especially difficult to see birth years that were the same as our own and imagine being in any one of their positions at 13 or 14 years old. I cannot imagine how it could have felt to learn that a man known as the Butcher of Bosnia, Ratko Mladić, and the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) had promised to return Srebrenica to the Serbs and “take revenge upon the Turks in this region.” Nor can I imagine how it must have felt to be part of the 25,000 refugees gathered at Potočari awaiting evacuation in July 1995 when Mladić and his army began their attack and United Nations forces repeatedly failed to provide protection.Thinking about it for too long makes it hard to believe in the goodwill of others, particularly as we come up on the most divisive US election cycle I’ve personally experienced. Humankind repeats itself regularly enough for me to see obvious behavioral patterns between the Bosnian War and what’s happening in the US and parts of Europe today:  Social, ethnic, and racial tensions exacerbated by the rhetoric of demagogues  Violent language resulting in violent actions  Families and friends turning against each other based on differences like race, ethnicity, and religion  The defining of “us” as human and “them” as less-than-human and thus undeserving of respect, protection, and even lifeIt’s very important for us to pay attention to the mistakes of our collective past and work together to avoid repeating them.This election is really, really important, but especially for Bosnian Americans because we have seen what hate speech can do in a country. Some of the older ones are scared, because this is a similar thing going on back in Bosnia in the 1990s before the election.Ibro Tucakovic in “How Missouri’s ‘Bosnian vote​’ could cost Donald Trump – and turn the state blue”Return TripWe ate lunch in Srebrenica then headed back toward Sarajevo and talked about lighter things. We learned that our guide dislikes vegetables, but especially hates buranija (string beans). A roadside stand was advertising buranija, and our guide didn’t know the English word for the vegetable, so he described them: very common at holiday functions, their parts can be separated and used in different types of dishes, and “you eat them and then you throw it back up.”When talking about Bosnian politics, our guide quoted his favorite rapper to explain the process: “it’s all about the benjamins.” It seems our political systems aren’t so different after all!Our guide to Srebrenica is 30, so he was about 10 when he and his family returned to Sarajevo through Tunel Spasa for his father. He lived through war, as his parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents all had. While acknowledging historic tensions between ethnic groups, he joked that, because his wife was half Croatian, half-Serb and he was Bosniak, they got to celebrate three times as many holidays. He also pointed out his home as we walked back into the old city in Sarajevo and took us to the candy shop with the best lokum so he could buy some for us before we parted ways.We had a lot of time to talk, and it was apparent that many of the things he has lived through were difficult to discuss, but he shared a part of himself with Rachel and me that day nonetheless. There is no more effective way to learn from and empathize with others than through the sharing of stories and time. My view of the world has been impacted by that which he shared with us. I hope that we contributed something new and positive to his worldview, as well.Coming SoonPhotos and stories from our drive to Dubrovnik.Reading ListJoe Sacco wrote a graphic novel on another UN-designated safe area attacked during the Bosnian war.

        "title": "The Balkans: Sarajevo to Dubrovnik",
        "excerpt":"Goodbye, SarajevoOur taxi driver, Mili, picked us up in Sarajevo at 8AM. We headed west and then south with an end destination of Dubrovnik. Mili recommended several stops along the way so we could see points in the history of Bosnia as well as the dramatic shift from mountainous to Mediterranean geography and climate.KonjićKonjić is one of Bosnia’s oldest settlements, a sleepy town straddling the Neretva river. Its population is majority Bosniak, though sizeable groups of Croats and Serbs also live there.                                  The Neretva is a karst river and provides the area with drinking water as well as hydroelectric power. We followed it all the way to Mostar.JablanicaWe stopped in Jablanica so Mili could show us the site of an event famous enough to be worthy of a film: the Battle of Neretva. As told to us, Tito and his army were trapped against the Neretva by Axis soldiers while trying to save the wounded. Tito had the railway bridges across the river destroyed to trick Axis soldiers into thinking they had fled in a different direction than they actually went. Many of Tito’s troops were able to escape due to this move, and Tito’s pledge not to leave the wounded behind was maintained.                                  As we drove south of Jablanica the mountain forest terrain gave way to Mediterranean; tall trees thinned out and were replaced by vineyards, olive and citrus trees.                                  MostarWhen we left Sarajevo the temperature was around 5°C / 40°F. By the time we arrived in Mostar, it was 28°C / 82°F. Mostar is Mili’s hometown, so we parked and he showed us around.                                  The photo below on the left was taken in 1993 in Mostar’s old city during the Bosnian war. The photo on the right was taken during our walk through the old city area, which was still pretty full of tourists despite it being the end of the major tourist season.                                                                Mili led us off the main path and took us to his in-law’s café where we were introduced to the philosophy behind Bosnian coffee, or Bosanska kafa. Behold:Mili’s brother-in-law emphasized that the purpose of Bosnian coffee was to give one time to reset or reflect. You wake up, consider all the things you have to do, and then think “but first, coffee” and allow yourself 15 minutes to pause before starting the day. It’s also something to be taken with friends so that you can enjoy and share time with each other.The preparation of Bosanska kafa is similar to Turkish coffee but Bosnians emphasize that it is also very different. I’m the wrong person to educate you on those nuances. I can, however, share the coffee-making steps we were given:  Put extra finely ground coffee into a coffee pot (džezva) at a ratio of 1-2 teaspoons per serving  Pour about 2 ounces of boiling water per serving over the grounds and stir  Put over heat and bring to a boil once (versus three times for Turkish coffee)  Pour a few spoons of cold water over the top of the coffee to help pull the grounds in the foam down to the bottom; this should also help make crema, which our guide referred to as the best part of the coffee  Use a spoon to scrape loose any remaining grounds around the rim of the coffee pot  Spoon a little bit of the crema into each cup  Slowly pour the coffee, being careful not to tip the pot so far as to pour a bunch of grounds into the cups; some will inevitably make it in anyway, and that’s perfectly fine if you sip slowlyAccording to Mili’s brother-in-law, Bosnian coffee is not prepared with sugar in the pot or in the cups. Rather, you dip a sugar cube into the coffee, take a small bite off of it, and then hold the sugar on your tongue while drinking so that the coffee is sweetened en route. I don’t take sugar with mine, but I do love rahat lokum (essentially Turkish delight) which is served alongside the coffee. Rosewater is a traditional flavor served with coffee. Our guide to Srebrenica took us to a shop in Sarajevo and bought us several other varieties to try. My favorite thus far is pistachio with shredded coconut.After coffee we started toward Dubrovnik.Drive to DubrovnikMili knew of a border crossing that had recently been opened to tourists and wasn’t as heavily trafficked as the main route into Dubrovnik. This was estimated to save us anywhere from one to several hours of wait time at the border. The drive isn’t one I would have done myself— the roads were windy, steep, and narrow—though the views as we went from mountain roads to flat farmland were really stunning.                                  As Mili had promised, our transition from Bosnia to Croatia was quick and uneventful. We drove on more windy, steep, and narrow roads that ran us alongside the Adriatic sea and eventually delivered us to our hotel near the Dubrovnik port.After we settled in, we took a taxi to the old city, had dinner, went to the War Photo Limited museum, and then enjoyed a sunset drink along the city wall.

        "excerpt":"KorčulaOur catamaran to Korčula wasn’t scheduled to depart until the early evening, so we walked around the Port of Dubrovnik, ate lunch at a cute restaurant on the bay, and then read by the hotel pool.Our hotel was very close to the port. This didn’t keep us from being anxious about missing the boat, so we positioned ourselves at a café across from the dock an hour before boarding time and waited for the queue to start to build before heading over. Once onboard, Rachel snagged us a table spot along the windows on the upper deck, and we settled in for our two-hour trip.AirbnbWe took a speed boat taxi from the port in Korčula to our Airbnb. It was a fun, five-minute ride that cost about 100 kuna, or $13, which was well worth it. Though it would have only been a 20-minute walk, house addresses along the road didn’t really exist and it was getting dark.The taxi dropped us off on the little dock where the blue boat is tied up. Our apartment was the second (or first in European terms) floor of the house in front of the dock.                                  This seems like an appropriate time to praise Rachel’s apartment-hunting skills. The location was an excellent place to pause and relax. We spent mornings and evenings on the porch drinking Bosnian coffee and Croatian wine while listening to boats moving through the bay. The apartment was within walking distance of the old city, and we could swim whenever we wanted.                                                                                                                                                                                        We only ended up swimming in the bay outside our apartment once while on Korčula, but for no other reason than we opted to spend most of our time wandering around the old city and surrounding area. It felt like about 27°C/80°F in the sun, and the water was around 22°C/72°F. I took the GoPro in to experiment with shots underwater. The center photo, which I’ll call housespongebee, is my favorite attempt at expressing my Surrealist self.                                                                                              CatsOur host was very kind to us and to those around her. She had somewhere around ten outdoor cats that she fed, so we had a lot of visitors. The main three are captured below. The grey cat made a surprise appearance in the apartment while we were reading one afternoon.                                                                                              Old cityKorčula was a bit more expensive to dine and shop in than it had been in Sarajevo, though it was still less expensive than other port towns like Dubrovnik and Split. The old city wasn’t very big, but there were lots of shops, restaurants, and galleries to explore.                                                                                                                                                                                        Bells ringing in Korčula's portThe weather was especially beautiful for autumn, and the timing of our visit was perfect. Shops started closing down for the season the day that we left.Maksimilijan gardenWe walked to Maksimilijan garden on a particularly warm yet breezy day, got a drink, and relaxed by the shore. Bob Marley always seems to be playing in the background in environments such as this, and so it was when we were there. We watched different sizes of boats pass between our island and the next. A wind surfer was out taking advantage of the strong gusts; it looked like a fight with the elements that the person was losing.                                  We stopped inside the garden’s gallery/museum on our way back toward town. The day we visited was the last before closing for the season. We and two other groups of people were the only ones around.                                  Around the islandOur ferry to Split wouldn’t arrive until about 6pm on our last day, so we decided to rent a car and check out the rest of the island. This proved to be a very memorable experience because of the magnificent scenery and the very narrow roads running alongside precipitous cliffs. We took it all in stride (ha!) in a little VW Polo with a very loose clutch.                                                                                              The stress of the drive proved itself to be worthwhile. For instance, a handful of hairpin turns down a 1200-foot decline on a one-car road led us to this. On our walk down to the bay, we heard rustling from the bushes and concluded that the only way our drive down could be made more exciting was if we were then charged by a boar. Thankfully, we were not.                                  Korčula isn’t a very big island at about 30 miles long and 5 miles wide, so we followed the main roads from Korčula, the old city, on the east to Vela Luka on the west. We made stops in Lumbarda, Pupnatska Luka (with the hairpin turns), Čara, and Blato. The entire trip took about 4.5 hours, including a stop for coffee and another for lunch.                                                                                                                                    Once we found what seemed to be the only gas station on the east side of the island and filled up, we returned the car and hung out near the port until our ferry arrived at dusk.

        "excerpt":"SplitThe ferry ride to Split was full without being uncomfortable. Rachel and I sat toward the bow, which afforded us a nice view of port entries and the sunset.                                  Our neighbors included a couple with an energetic and charming child around 2 years old, a New Zealander toward the end of his post-college travels around the world, and his companion-of-the-moment who left the ferry in Hvar. The neighboring child commandeered the majority of our attention with her dancing and dramatic facial expressions, punctuated by spontaneous sprints down the aisles. Our friend from New Zealand seemed to be experiencing the worst hangover of his life and was trying to figure out whether he should book a room in a hostel or stay overnight in Split’s airport for his early morning flight the following day.The water was pretty choppy so the ferry couldn’t run at full speed. We arrived about 45 minutes later than anticipated. Upon arrival, we walked from the harbor to our Airbnb, which was nested inside the maze of Roman cobblestone streets that is Diocletian’s palace.                                                                The pace and energy was a dramatic shift from the mellow vibe of Korčula. It was Saturday night. The city was filled with music coming from dance clubs as well as local performers. Gangs of teenagers roamed the streets looking for their next source of entertainment. People dined in restaurants and drank at bars tucked into every available corner of the old, walled downtown area.Rachel and I went out for dinner at the quietest place we could find and were grateful that the windows in our apartment were incredibly effective at blocking out sound.We left our apartment at 7:30 to get to the car rental by 8am. The streets we’d seen just hours before looked completely different when occupied primarily by pigeons.                                                                                                  We walked along the eerily calm and empty harbor for about 10-15 minutes and passed storefronts, homes, and unoccupied buildings before reaching the car rental office. We were, of course, early enough that we beat the employees there. Rain threatened to make our wait outside uncomfortable, but it passed by without incident.                                  We stopped into a Konzum (grocery store) to stock up on water and snacks on our way to the rental car pickup location, which was in a strip filled with half-finished structures a few blocks from the office. The lot attendants hung out on lawn chairs in one such hollowed-out building.                                  Split was a good stopping point for us on our trip north toward Plitvice and Zagreb. The history of Diocletian’s palace is very interesting; the buildings and statues throughout are really beautiful. It is, however, very obviously a port city focused on appealing to tourists and party-goers.Coming SoonPhotos from our trip to Plitvice.","categories": [],

        "title": "The Balkans: Plitvice",
        "excerpt":"Driving NorthWe drove through periods of rain and high winds as we left Split and headed through the mountains to Plitvice. Tunnels allowed us to cut through without too many sharp turns, though our little Opel Astra struggled to accelerate up the steeper inclines.                                  We eventually left the highway for scenic country roads intermittently interrupted by small towns.  One of the first towns I remember encountering was Korenica, which is right along the border of Bosnia-Herzegovina near Bihać. This region was central to Operation Storm, one of the last major operations of the Croatian war and a strategic victory in the Bosnian war. The Serb army appears to have used this town as a base during the wars. There were a lot of Orthodox graves and empty houses on one side of town, while the other side was newer and more developed.Plitvice National ParkObligatory Balkan war fact: The first shots of the Croatian war for independence in 1991 were fired at Plitvice.I’ve never seen anything like what we saw here. Our first view was from a cliffside looking down at the lower lakes. Impending rain made the greens and blues feel deeper and more dramatic.                                  As we wound down the path to the lakes, the colors and sounds became even more vivid. Our photos really don’t do the experience justice.                                                                                                                                                                                        We entered the park early enough to avoid a lot of tourist traffic. It was still tricky to navigate past clusters of them on the narrow platforms, which allowed us to walk beside and across the lakes.    It started raining lightly, so Rachel and I moved quickly past the groups to get to the boats that would take us from the lower to the upper lakes.                                                                                                                                                                                        When we arrived at the boats, it started raining heavily and continued to do so for the remainder of our time in the park.                                                                The ride across the lake was very wet and very peaceful.  By this time in our journey, Rachel’s rain jacket had decided to give up; water rushed through through a breach in the outer wall. We decided to catch a bus back to our entry and call it a day after we arrived on the other side of the lake.                                                                                              We drove along more country roads and through fascinating looking little towns on our way from Plitvice to Zagreb. We thought we’d spotted a bear and two cubs not long after we’d departed Plitvice. To our embarassment, they were just incredibly realistic-looking cutouts in the rain. Slunj had some war memorials along the roadside, one of which was heavily tagged with graffiti. We also passed a town with war machinery on display in a yard along the road. The rain kept us from stopping for a closer look, so we’ve marked these locations for further exploration next time we visit.Coming SoonPhotos from our time in Zagreb.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"ZagrebRain followed us from Plitvice to Zagreb. We arrived late enough on a Sunday that we found a place to eat dinner, hung our wet clothes throughout the apartment in a vain attempt to dry them, were serenaded by a neighbor (listen below), and then went to bed.A neighbor singing along with Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love YouIt was still raining a little bit when we woke up. Zvonko, our host, lent us a couple of umbrellas, and we started our excursion. After breakfast, we wandered around the upper town, or old part of the city.                                                                                                                                We also visited two museums: The Museum of Broken Relationships and The Croatian Museum of Naïve Art. I recommend visiting both should you find yourself in Zagreb.The Museum of Broken Relationships was filled with remnants of—you guessed it—relationships that had ended. Stories accompanied most of the artifacts and covered a broad range of emotions: funny, sincere, sad, poetic.The Croatian Museum of Naïve Art is a small building with a well-curated collection of work focused on a period in the 20th century when a group of untrained painters and sculptors developed their own conceptual approach to art. The museum’s site sums this up better than I can:The Naive is the consequence and proof of democratisation in both the general relations in society and in artistic creation. It clearly shows that everyone has the right to express himself or herself in art and that schools of art are in themselves no guarantee of artistic value, because art can be created even without them. In the Naive, emotion counts more than reason and intellectual speculations. In the majority of cases, the Naive expresses the joy of life and the victory of hope. Here we can discover “the forgotten nature” and “lost childhood”, stories and dreams, a vital imagination and simple human inventions, the forgotten “wonder at the world” and the ability to rejoice in motif. But the Naive is not just an Arcadian art and idyll, it does not express only trust in and celebration of life; there are some sorry tales in it too, some dark and chthonic accords; in the Naive we can also come across the tragic and the symbolic, the fantastic and the irreal, surreal relationships, somnambulism and unreality, which all means that it is made up of a hundred opposites, just like Life.The color and detail of the art was made even more pronounced by the fact that many pieces were painted onto glass.                                                                Zagreb’s an interesting city. It reminded me of somewhere I’d been before but also felt completely foreign. Austria-Hungary’s influence on the city is clear, but it was when we were walking through Ban Jelačić Square that it hit me: the city has a similar feel to Paris. Musicians were playing music on the streets and in the squares; open markets and green spaces abound; art—commissioned and otherwise—covers most surfaces; and people sit outside at cafés, under blankets and heat lamps if necessary.Street musicians in Zagreb performing a cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit; a tram passes by.                                   We didn’t know what to expect from Zagreb and consequently didn’t devote enough time on this trip to it. It’s on our list of places to return to, preferably when it’s not raining.Zagreb to LjubljanaZagreb Glavni kolodvor is the main hub of the Croatian railway network, and it’s where we left Zagreb for Ljubljana, Slovenia. One of the first things we found was the passport photo booth:                                  We also bought books, burek, and coffee. We had a reasonable amount of time to kill while waiting for our train to arrive, so I made surreal art by misusing the pano mode on my phone.                                                                                              We had a compartment to ourselves on the train, which afforded us the opportunity for further mischief and photo-taking.

        "excerpt":"SloveniaAside from a 30-minute stop at the Croatian-Slovenian border where passports and the train itself were inspected, we spent most of our time watching and listening to cities and countryside pass us by on our way to Ljubljana.Sounds on the train ride from Zagreb to Ljubljana  LjubljanaOur host had a taxi-driving friend pick us up from the train station and take us to our Airbnb, which was attached to the host’s place of employment: a coffee shop and bar filled with a reasonable sampling of working-class folks. We were located within walking distance of Ljublana’s center. On our first night, we were greeted by vivid cloudscapes, little workers on sewage covers, and an incredible dinner at Le Petit Cafe.                                                                                                                                We also explored the old part of the city and found lots of cute shops, bars, art, and musicians near the canal.                                                                                                                                                                                        Street musician playing along the canal in Ljubljana's city center                                  Vintgar GorgeWe rented a car to visit a few places elsewhere in Slovenia. The roads and scenery were impressive, as was our little Opel Adam, which handled mountain inclines much better than the previous car.Vintgar gorge was the first destination on a whirlwind day trip. It’s tucked into the far east corner of Triglav National Park, whose namesake is the highest mountain of the Julian Alps at about 9,400 feet tall. Triglav is also featured in Slovenia’s coat of arms.                                                                                                                                                                                        Look closely at the banks to see the piles of stones people have stacked along the river in the video below.  On our way down the gorge, we spotted what we think was a marten along the bank of the river on the opposite side. As we passed back through on our return trip, the marten decided to take a swim and say hello from a little bit closer.  Lake BledWe went from Vintgar gorge to Lake Bled, which was about 15 minutes away. Because we had a dinner reservation at Hiša Franko later that evening, we stayed long enough to take pictures, eat a piece of Lake Bled’s famed cream cake, and drink a coffee.                                                                                                                                Hiša FrankoWe (ignorantly) thought the drive from Ljubljana to Hiša Franko would be a simple two hour drive there and then back. As we left the highway for country roads, it became apparent that the drive might not be as simple as we thought in the dark and after a large meal. This was our route. Be sure to zoom in for get a better idea of the fun we had.Dark clouds sometimes gathered and wind sometimes whipped over us while Triglav and the surrounding mountains loomed in the background; brief bursts of fear were balanced out with amazement at the scenery. I did my best to capture some of what we encountered but couldn’t spare you the jostling of the camera resulting from wind. I did remove the sound to protect your ears.      At long last, we arrived at our destination:                                  We were, of course, the first guests to arrive for the evening. Rachel’s enjoying the last of a parmesan popsicle in the image below. I still think about that bread on the table.                                  If you enjoy fancy meals, check out the Chef’s Table episode on Ana Ros and then promptly book your flight to Slovenia. It’s an experience you will not regret. My only suggestion is that you opt to stay at the hotel on the premises rather than drive back to Ljubljana in the dark like Rachel and I did. This part of our return trip was perhaps my favorite, particularly in combination with lane closures for construction. Rachel, hero of the evening, drove while I stared only at the map and attempted to warn her about what was coming next.Pro tip: Sometimes Google maps downplay the severity of turns in the road. Take ‘em slow.Coming SoonWe took a day trip to Venice in between adventures in Slovenia. We’ll end this blog series there!","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"VeniceWe took a day trip to Venice with a group of five other people in between our adventures in Slovenia. Ambroz, our guide from Roundabout travel picked us up at 8am. We parked around 11 and walked into the city via the Constitution Bridge over the Grand Canal.In essence, this was the first time either of us had seen Venice: It was my actual first visit to the city, but on her last visit as a moderately rebellious 14 year old, Rachel decided to leave her glasses at home. It didn’t work out well for her.                                                                                              Though we were told that the crowds were pretty light, they seemed quite heavy at times. In the more touristy areas of the city, there were loads of people in gondolas who’d paid 80 Euro for a 20-minute ride and probably didn’t move more than a few hundred feet. We opted not to spend money on that experience.Glory be to glasses, Rachel got to appreciate the detail in St. Mark’s Cathedral this time around. It was magnificent and very crowded.                                                                After a brief tour with our guide, we took to the less-trafficked streets on our own, ate at a little café by a campo, or square, and then wandered around.                                                                Musicians in a campo in VeniceThe city was really charming. Each street had a slightly different look and feel. We found some with art shops and wine stores, others with laundry hanging out to dry on lines overhead, some that ended in canals, and we even witnessed someone throwing a key down from the second floor to a person at ground level so they could let themselves in.                                                                Sounds from along a canal in VeniceAfter several hours, we met up with our group and took a water taxi back to the area where we parked. The taxis are the same type of boats used in James Bond’s speed boat chase, though they never go very fast. It was a great way to see the city, and it cost significantly less at 12 Euro per person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The trip lasted about twelve hours total and was a great way to get a feel for the city. Next time we visit, we’ll head straight to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and we’ll also check out La Bienniale.The EndThis marks the end of my posts on our fall 2016 trip to the Balkans and Venice. Stay tuned for reports from the next adventure.","categories": [],
