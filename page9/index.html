        Social Media and the Arab Uprisings: Egypt's Background
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2015</span>

    <h3>What triggered the movements in Egypt?</h3>

<p>The MENA region was watching as Tunisians ousted their autocratic regime. Egyptians undoubtedly saw similarities in their own situation—a repressive, corrupt regime and growing economic disparity. Ben Ali fled Tunisia on January 14, 2011; soon after, Egypt&#39;s initial call to arms was set for January 25th.</p>

<h4><em>Corruption</em></h4>

<p>An Egyptian intellectual coined the term <em>julukiyya</em> to describe a monarchy (<em>malakiyya</em>) disguised by outward displays of republicanism (<em>jumhuriyya</em>) <a href="#mcmurray">(McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 214)</a>. The term has been used to describe Mubarak&#39;s Egypt. Presidential elections were a one-party referendum up until 2005, and many suspected that Hosni Mubarak was grooming his son, Gamal, to succeed him. He had already been put in government and party roles related to furthering the neoliberalization of the economy; resultant private-sector developments helped the Mubaraks amass billions of dollars in personal wealth.</p>

<p>Mubarak and the National Democratic Party (NDP) entertained appeals for democracy through the careful control of political parties and elections as well as other civic organizations, &quot;providing space for just enough participatory politics to keep people busy without threatening regime dominance&quot; <a href="#elghobashyi">(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1611)</a> and, unlike in Tunisia, the media was relatively free. Mubarak didn&#39;t try to suppress dissent so much as manage it. He relied upon the state police forces to promote fear, distrust, and disunity. Additionally, rather than acting on behalf of workers, the Egyptian Trade Union Federation was used as a state-sanctioned means of control over them.</p>

<p>The military—or &quot;Military Inc.&quot; <a href="#marshall">(Marshall &amp; Stacher, 2013, pp. 2879-2886)</a>—has historically had its own political and economic priorities. For instance, the army controls industries ranging from the production of olive oil to voting booths. Since military holdings and spending are considered to be state secrets, no one knows exactly how much of Egypt&#39;s economy the military controls. It is known, however, that the army &quot;oversees numerous subsidiaries of state-owned holding companies and owns shares in public-private ventures. In many cases, these smaller operations are embedded in transnational conglomerates that reach into several economic sectors, from construction and maritime shipping to weapons manufacturing&quot; <a href="#marshall">(Marshall &amp; Stacher, 2013, p. 2887)</a>.</p>

<h4><em>Economic disparity</em></h4>

<p>Like Tunisia, Egypt also became indebted to foreign lenders and was subject to structural adjustment plans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Funds for public services were cut and privatization plans were initiated under President Sadat and then expanded upon under Mubarak. Land was consolidated into large tracts for industrial agriculture and real estate development and managed by private corporations or wealthy families. In the 1980s, the World Bank led infrastructure-building efforts for tourist development using public funds and then routed profits from it into privately controlled outside entities in the 1990s. One young man&#39;s assessment of working in the tourist development was that &quot;life was a meal you never got to eat&quot; <a href="#mitchell">(Mitchell, 2013, p. 2064)</a>.</p>

<p>Prices rose and wages remained the same or declined. In 2008, there were shortages of bread at the subsidized cost, and bread in private bakeries cost 5 times as much. This was unaffordable to some 40 percent of the population living on less than $2 per day and resulted in riots.</p>

<p>Egypt had a large percentage of youth—two thirds of the population were under the age of 30, and unemployment rates were 10 times greater for college graduates than those without a degree <a href="#castells">(Castells, 2013, p. 1044)</a>. Underemployment was another concern. In 2010, estimates suggested that 3 million Egyptians had been hired as temp workers with monthly salaries around 100 Egyptian pounds per month (<a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=100&amp;From=EGP&amp;To=USD">about $13</a>), without health benefits, and under terms that gave employers the right to fire them without reason or warning. The government&#39;s increase of the monthly minimum wage to 400 Egyptian pounds (<a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=400&amp;From=EGP&amp;To=USD">about $52</a>) didn&#39;t apply to any of the 7 million people working in the informal economy.</p>

<h4><em>Repression</em></h4>

<p>The impunity of Mubarak&#39;s police force became well known over the course of his three decades in power. El Ghobashyi noted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The coercive apparatus had become the chief administrative arm of the state, aggregating the functions of several agencies. Police not only dealt with crime and issued passports, drivers’ licenses, and birth and death certificates. They also resolved local conflicts over land and sectarian relations; fixed all national and sub-national elections; vetted graduate school candidates and academic appointments at every level; monitored shop floors and mediated worker-management conflicts; observed soccer games and Friday prayers; and maintained a network of local informants in poor neighborhoods, to ensure that dispossession was not converted into political organization <a href="#elghobashyi">(McMurray &amp; Ufheil-Somers, 2013, p. 1676)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anti-terrorism laws were used to justify attacks on Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. Reports of torture became so commonplace that the regime didn&#39;t bother denying them. Egyptians were pushed to the brink in 2010 when word spread that police had dragged a young man, Khalid Sa&#39;id, out of an Internet cafe and then beaten him to death. It was alleged to be petty drug arrest, but Sa&#39;id had recently shared a video exposing police corruption.</p>

<h3>How was the revolution accomplished?</h3>

<p>By the time Tunisia&#39;s regime fell, Egyptians were ready to take on their own government. Appropriately enough, January 25th was a bank holiday designated &quot;Police Day,&quot; so the date was set.</p>

<h4><em>Social media</em></h4>

<p>Social media was used heavily in the days leading up to January 25th. The organization that started a “We Are All Khalid Sa‘id” Facebook page and staged protests against police brutality and human rights abuses in 2010 was also a significant player in the demonstrations against the government on January 25, 2011. Videos sharing scenes of police brutality were used to call Egyptians to join them in the street. Protest groups from many different backgrounds—worker&#39;s unions, actors, soccer fans, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgZMz3encLE">Khalid Sa&#39;id&#39;s mother</a>—confirmed their participation and urged others to join them in opposition to the regime <a href="#elghobashyi">(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1712)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="april6"></a>
The April 6 Youth Movement was formed in solidarity with textile workers in 2008 and had a following of over 70,000 people on Facebook. One of its founders, Asmaa Mafhouz, posted a video on Facebook on January 18th calling Egyptians to action:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are going to Tahrir on January 25th … If you stay home, you deserve all that’s being done to you, and you will be guilty before your nation and your people. Go down to the street, send SMSs, post it on the Net, make people aware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video went viral, leading it to be referred to as “The Vlog that Helped Spark the Revolution” <a href="#castells">(Castells, 2013, p. 877)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="shutdown"></a>On January 27th, the government shut down Internet and cellular phone service in an attempt to keep protestors from communicating with each other. The reaction this elicited was apparently unexpected by the police, but as Sadek noted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if I were an apathetic young person who could not care less about the political protests, if you took away something vital to my daily life I would go out and protest against that. Many people joined the protests that day only because when Internet and phones were cut off they could not find out what was going on any other way. And once they felt the power of freedom even for a minute, they could not go back <a href="#sadek">(Sadek, 2012, p. 1132)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Activists across the globe also pooled resources to help connect Egyptians to each other in the same way they had for Tunisians.</p>

<h4><em>Organized movements</em></h4>

<p>Mubarak&#39;s security forces maintained control by promoting fragmentation and distrust between interest groups. Even well-organized movements with large followings like that of the April 6 Youth were effectively suppressed when they went up against the regime by themselves. In 2009, a political scientist with allegiance to Mubarak illustrated how confident the regime was in its control, saying “widespread, politically motivated unrest was unlikely because it was not part of the ‘Egyptian mentality’&quot;<a href="#elghobashyi">(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1653)</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the government&#39;s success record against protests, the 2000s were a decade of increased incidents of collective action, and it took place in the street. Between 2004 and 2008, over 2,000 strikes consisting of 1.5 million Egyptian workers were held. They demanded increases in pay and fair working conditions. Between 2004 and 2011, middle class activist groups and professional associations organized rallies and protests against the continued use of emergency laws and the repression of journalists. Political demonstrations united student, Islamist, labor, and professional groups. Even the fan networks of Egyptian soccer teams had a history of demonstrations against the police. The obviously rigged results of the national legislative elections at the end of 2010 also enraged citizens and political elites to protest in December 2010 <a href="#elghobashyi">(El Ghobashyi, 2013, pp. 1698-1703)</a> and contributed to the unification that occurred on January 25th.</p>

<p>By January 2011, organizers had seasoned tactics for combatting Mubarak&#39;s security forces. They started by publicly announcing a false time and location for January 25th&#39;s demonstrations and then disseminating actual plans by phone so that they could gather large crowds on their way through side streets and then overwhelm security forces as they encountered them <a href="#elghobashyi">(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1749)</a>. In the days that followed, additional groups such as the Nasserists and the Muslim Brothers joined the protests. <a name="jan28"></a> On Friday, January 28th, the masses surrounded the institutions they associated with Mubarak&#39;s regime—police stations, government buildings, and NDP headquarters—and demanded their removal.</p>

<p>The mobilization and unification of vastly different interest groups—industrial and farm laborers, civil and professional workers, students, religious, political, and social organizations—behind a single message caught the regime off guard and led to the eventual removal of Mubarak. El Ghobashyi asserts, &quot;The genius of the Egyptian revolution was its methodical restoration of the public weal. The uprising restored the meaning of politics, if by that term is understood the making of collective claims on government. It revalued the people, revealing them in all their complexity-neither heroes nor saints, but citizens&quot; <a href="#elghobashyi">(El Ghobashyi, 2013, p. 1981)</a>.</p>

<h3>February 2011</h3>

<p>A regime accustomed to serially addressing disparate protest groups was unable to withstand Egyptians&#39; united front. The people rejected the economic policies that had steadily increased the gap between rich and poor for decades. They rejected pervasive corruption and repression and embraced the hope for reform that Tunisia&#39;s uprising had instilled within them, and they effectively utilized social media to organize and disseminate their message. When the military refused to fire on protestors and removed their support from the regime, Hosni Mubarek had little choice but to resign; he did so on February 11, 2011. After witnessing what happened in Egypt, the people of the MENA region began to rise up in demand of dignity and in opposition to their own repressive and corrupt regimes.</p>

<h3>Why this matters</h3>

<p>In <em>Demanding Dignity</em>, Dina Sadek recounts a scene she witnessed as she stood in Tahrir Square:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am never going to forget the face of an older man in his sixties who was standing in the square. He was checking on a young man who had a bandage on his head due to being injured by a stone. The old man cried and apologized to the young protester, “I am sorry, I am really sorry you have to go through this now. If only my generation had been brave enough to do this a long time ago, you wouldn’t have to go through this now <a href="#sadek">(Sadek, 2012, p. 1090)</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ben Ali and Mubarak aren&#39;t the first leaders to blatantly abuse human rights and betray their constituents. Such atrocities often build gradually and systematically rather than appearing suddenly. Though it isn&#39;t a guaranteed deterrent against autocracy, we all can and should be vigilant against the diminishment of human rights.</p>

<p>With each technological advancement, we become more interconnected. This makes it easier to witness and react to crimes against humanity throughout the world. It also means that it&#39;s easier to become overwhelmed and desensitized, but if we aren&#39;t brave enough to stand up to those who violate our rights as humans now, we&#39;re setting future generations up for an even greater struggle. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best in his <a href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">letter from Birmingham jail</a>: &quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&quot;</p>
